40005	  Of course! The red, white, and yellow blouse has a score of 3.3, and the other has a score of 3.7.

40009	  It comes in XS, S, L, XXL and M.  
40100	  Do you like the dark green and blue ones on the left? They are blouses.  
40101	  Please clarify which item you are referring to.  
40102	  It is 29.99 and comes in L, XS, S, M, XL, and XXL.  
40103	  Of course, the black dress in the second cubby from the right has been rated a higher rating, at 2.9. The black dress on the rack is a large, while the black dress hanging on the right side of the floor has a higher rating at 4.9.  
40104	  I'm sorry, I don't have any other affordable grey dresses in extra large and black.  
40105	  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything in that size. Is there something else I can help you with?  
40106	  There are several highly rated jackets, including the blue one hanging against the wall, the grey and white one to its right, and the white and grey one on the rack. What do you think?  
40107	  You may like the top on the left side of that rack in front of you, and the other long-sleeved one above that one.

72502	  Nothing else I can show you.  
72503	  I'll update your cart with the jacket you requested.  
72504	  I'll put them in your cart.  
72505	  How about the black one hanging over the blue pants and the grey one hanging up front on the left.  
72506	  I found two grey pairs in the closet.  
72600	  How about the black one on the back of the display rack in the center?  
72601	  The black one comes in XS, S, L, and XL and is available in M, XS, and XXL. The one on the wall comes in XL and is available in XXL, XL, and M.

72604	  I am sorry I do not have anything in stock that meets your request for affordable tshirts.  
72605	  Do you like the grey and white shirt in the third cubby from the left?

72704	  Those hoodies come in all sizes, but the grey and white ones are the only ones I can offer.  
72705	  How about the black dress in the back of the room and the brown dress behind it?

147801	  They both have good ratings.  
147802	  I don't happen to have any inexpensive wooden ones.  
147803	  I am adding them to your cart.  
147900	  Not really. Do you want to search for anything?  
147901	  I've placed that couch in your cart.  
147902	  The white chair on the left might be your best bet, as does that white chair just to the left of it. Do any of these rugs match your new preferences?  
147903	  Sure, I am receiving a ton of assistance in your requested purchases. I am now confirming your purchase.  
148000	  Sure! Let's start with the two black and white ones you already saw.

148603	  Of course, both of those chairs are now in your cart.  
148700	  Sorry, I don't have any cheap chairs.  
148701	  I'll add that to your cart.  
148702	  I don't have anything like that at the moment. Can I get you something else?  
148703	  Sure thing.  
148800	  What do you think of the white area rugs on the left?  
148801	  What do you think of the grey rug in the front center and the white rug in the back left?

149003	  Certainly!  I'll add that to your cart.  
149100	  Yes, we have the light brown chair at the far end of the wall,  and the other brown chair behind the partition at the front.  
149101	  Unfortunately I don't have anything matching that criteria.  
149102	  Sure! How about this grey one in the back, or maybe the red one below? Both are by River Chateau.  
149103	  Oh, wow, great! I'll add those to your cart.  
149200	  I can help with that. Can you help with the white chair in front of the partition, the white chair up front, or the white chair in front of the partition?  
149201	  I can help with that. What do you think of those?  
149202	  Both of these items are made from wood and are cheaper.  
149203	  Sure thing. Both tables will be added to your cart.  
149300	  Here is a wooden one.  
149301	  I found this wooden shelf and the grey wooden shelf.  
149302	  The only one I have matching those specifications is the one to the right of that one. It is made of wood.  
149303	  I will add it to your cart.  
149400	  I would recommend the black table just to the left of the red sofa chair,  
149401	  Unfortunately, we don't have any more options like that. Can I help with something else?

149701	  Unfortunately, I don't have any chairs by that brand.  
149702	  How about the white ottoman on the rug up front or the white ottoman on the right?  
149703	  There's a grey rug against the right wall which might interest you.  
149800	  There's this gray one right up against the wall.  
149801	  I can't find anything matching that search. What else can I help you with?  
149802	  Alright, I will add that grey sofa and that coffee table to your cart.  
149803	  I'm sorry, that's all I have for blouses.

150100	  Take a look at the grey one and the brown one, or maybe the other brown one just beyond that.  
150101	  Sorry, I can't find anything that matches that criteria. Is there anything else I can help you find?  
150102	  Sure thing.  
150103	  I don't have any gray chairs with good ratings at this time.  
150200	  Do you like either of the two wooden shelves to the back right?

150503	  That table is $549.  
150600	  Sure! I have a grey sofa in the back left set by the entrance. What do you think?  
150601	  Perhaps that wooden shelf on the far left would be a good fit.  
150602	  The one in front is from StyleNow Feed and is rated 4.4. The one in front is from Modern Arts and is rated 3.8.  
150603	  Sorry, those are the only two shelves we have currently.

151400	  Sure, I can help you find a chair! I have the black chair on the left, the brown chair on the right, and the black and white chair next to it.  
151401	  Which items are you talking about?  
151402	  Those are the only similar items.

175102	  Sure thing, I've added it to your cart.  
175103	  Sorry, there are no cheap sofa with a good rating with a good rating.

175601	  I apologize, but there are no items that meet that search criteria.  
175602	  Which table?  
175603	  Thank you! It's made of wood.  
175700	  I see several. On either end of the room, a chair to the left is located at the far back.  
175701	  I found two brown chairs on the same side. What do you think?  
175702	  Sure thing!  
175703	  I also have a chair just to the right of that, with an identical color scheme, another white chair to the left of that and another white chair to the right of that.

176500	  Here's a brown one I found for you.  
176501	  Which one do you mean?  
176502	  That item has a rating of 2.8, and is made out of natural fibers.  
176503	  I have this brown coffee table up front on the blue rug.

176602	  That table is by StyleNow Feed.  
176603	  This one is made by Home Store.

177003	  Both of them are made by Uptown Studio. The one on the left costs $399 and is made of wool. The one on the right is a wood and costs $449.  
177100	  How do you like these ones?

177103	  Which one?

188803	  I couldn't find any similar tables in this price range.  
188900	  How do you feel about the black one and the white one on the right in the middle?  
188901	  Sure, what do you think of the two brown tables you just mentioned?  
188902	  Great!  I'll add both of those tables to your cart.  
188903	  Sure, the one on the left is from Uptown Gallery, and the one on the right is from StyleNow Feed.  
189000	  I have one red one in the back right corner!  
189001	  Sure, I'll add those both to your cart.  
189002	  That's the only chair like that.  
189003	  Sure thing. They're in your cart.  
189100	  Do you like either the grey one in the back, or the other grey one on the left?  
189101	  Sure thing, I added it to your cart.  
189102	  Which table do you mean?  
189103	  That table is made of wood and sells for $399.  
189200	  What do you think about the grey sofa chair on the red rug in the center of the room?  
189201	  The two white sofas in the far right corner would match your criteria.  
189202	  Sorry, those are the only items I have that would match that description.  
189203	  Sorry, I don't have anything that matches that criteria.  
189300	  Sure, we have the grey table on the left side of the partition in back and another grey table on the right in the middle of the room.  
189301	  For which ones?  
189302	  Both are made from metal.  
189303	  Those two tables are both made of wood and have a customer rating of 4.7.  
189400	  Sure, there's two of them straight ahead on the left, there's also a short grey option just to the right of it.  
189401	  Sorry, I'm afraid it doesn't look like we have anything like that.  
189402	  No problem, it's leather from Art Den.  
189403	  Sorry, but no item matches your criteria. What else can I do for you?  
189500	  I think the red sofa in the back will do just fine.  
189501	  That sofa is made by that brand.  
189502	  I don't have any sofa that would match your criteria.  
189503	  That's the only sofa I can find that fits your description.  
189600	  I've got the first one to the right of the partition wall, and the one the taller on the left side.  
189601	  The wooden end table on the right is made of metal and that table on the left is made of wood.  
189602	  In the back right corner on the grey rug, I have that white chair.  
189603	  You've got it! I will add the end table to your cart now.  
189700	  Take a look at the grey sofa in the back of the room, or the white one in front of it.

189800	  I found this gray rug at the back right.  
189801	  Of course, I will do that now.  
189802	  I'm sorry, that doesn't seem to be possible. Can I get you something else?  
189803	  Sure, the grey one on the back left, to the right of the couch, has a good rating.  
189900	  How about this one?  
189901	  Sure! Take a look at the wooden table on the left, as well as the blue sofa behind it.  
189902	  I apologize, but I do not have any more sofas.

190300	  Ok, actually, what about this white sofa chair by the blue rug, or the white one towards the back on the blue rug?  
190301	  Sorry, I don't have any other sofa chairs in white.  
190302	  Unfortunately, I don't have anything from that brand.  Is there anything else I can help you find?  
190303	  Sure, what do you think of the grey rug, or maybe the white rug in the back of the room?  
190400	  I've got the one in the far back left, and the one just past it, with the white accent chair in the very back.

286601	  Which coffee table do you mean?  
286602	  That's made by Art Den and has a 3.6 rating.  
286603	  Unfortunately, we don't have any affordable accent chairs from Downtown Stylists in stock.  
286700	  Do you like this blue one on the left in front?  
286701	  No, I don't have any more like that right now.

286703	  Ok, I'll put those in your cart for you.  
286800	  The table in the middle of the room by the wall may be perfect for you. What do you think?  
286801	  What about the white sofa chairs against the wall?

287500	  There's a wooden coffee table in the back that you might like.

287702	  Which ones?  
287703	  We have this brown table on the white rug, and the black and white one next to it.  
287800	  Sure, how do you like the grey one to the left of the long-sleeved sofa chair, or could I ask you to suggest something else?  
287801	  I have these two options and it's certainly worth the costs.  
287802	  I have this one in the back, and this one on the right side of the white rug.

288601	  I'm sorry. The black one is in stock in XS and S, the blue one is available in XL, S, M, L, and XXL.  
288602	  Sure, it's available in XS, S, XL, XXL, and M.

288900	  Take a look at the grey coat in the second cubby to the right, the black coat in the same cubby to the left of that, or the grey coat in the cubby to the left of that one?  
288901	  Sure, I'll add both of those coats now.  
288902	  How about the black hat to the right of the light grey one?  
288903	  Which one do you mean?  
288904	  That is available in XS, S, M, and L and is in stock in XS.  
289000	  On the table, I have the black pair, the brown pair next to them, and the grey pair next to them.  
289001	  The one on the left is by River Chateau, and the one on the right is by Pedals & Gears.

315501	  Okay, I'll put it in your cart for you.  
315502	  I couldn't find anything that fits that description.  
315503	  There are both lamp and end table just to the left of that one. What do you think?  
315600	  How about the white rug on the right or the blue rug in the back?  
315601	  That lamp's already getting pretty popular, and I could certainly use you to help me pick out a new one for you! I could also use your suggestion for a lovely accent chair that might suit both of them!  
315602	  The lamps are made by Modern Arts, and they both cost $349.

335701	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything matching that description.  
335702	  That lamp is by Uptown Studio, and the other is by Modern Arts.  
335703	  Those two lamps are the only ones that meet that requirement.  
335800	  What do you think about the white chair or the brown chair?  
335801	  Could you clarify which chair you are referring to?  
335802	  It's from Uptown Studio and is $449.  
335803	  Sorry, I can't find anything that matches those criteria.  
335900	  Unfortunately I have no chairs by Modern Arts with good customer ratings.  
335901	  Okay, I will add that table and the one you just bought to your cart.  
335902	  Those are the only chairs we have.  
335903	  Which table are you referring to?  
336000	  What do you think of the white rug in the back?  
336001	  Could you clarify which chair you're interested in?

336102	  Ok! I'll update your cart.

336201	  What do you think of the wooden table in front of the other brown table?  
336202	  I don't have anything from that brand.  
336203	  Sorry, nothing matches your search criteria.  
336300	  What do you think of the grey chair on the right?  
336301	  For which armchair?  
336302	  That is by Cats Are Great and has a 4.9 customer rating.  
336303	  That chair in the back is what I have like that.  
336400	  Do you like the wooden one in the back?  
336401	  Which ones?  
336402	  Both have a 2.7 rating.  
336403	  I don't have anything that matches your search criteria.  
336500	  I do, I have this white rug up front on the right.  
336501	  Which rug do you mean?

336600	  There's a wooden table on the other side of the partition, and a wooden table in the very back.  
336601	  How do you like the table to the left by the bookshelves?  
336602	  The wood chair on the right by the bookshelves is white. The table by the beds is made of natural fibers.  
336603	  I'm sorry, we don't have any similar chairs. Can I help you find anything else?  
336700	  What do you think of the grey rug in the back corner, or the white rug to its left?  
336701	  That white area rug is unique in that it has similar ratings and prices as the blue rug in the back of the display.  
336702	  What do you think of the brown sofa chair behind the red sofa chair, the blue sofa chair just behind it and the other white couch chair in front of that.  
336703	  Unfortunately, I do not have any sofas with a good rating.  
336800	  The first white chair in the back left cubby, at the end of the display table, fits your search.  
336801	  I'm sorry, I don't have any couch chairs with natural fibers.  
336802	  How about this one in the front?

336902	  Certainly!  I'll update your cart with the red, white, and yellow one.  
336903	  Sorry, nothing here matches your criteria.  
337000	  Ok, I can help find that. I have the grey chair at the front right of the room, and the white chair in the very back.  
337001	  For which chair?  
337002	  The long one has good ratings and has a price of $349, and the shorter one has a rating of 2.8 and costs $549.  
337003	  Sorry, we don't have anything like that. Is there something else I can get for you?  
337100	  The white chair to the left of the blue sofa is black and white and has a good customer rating. The white chair facing us on the red rug is also black and white.  
337101	  Take a look at the wooden colored chair in the middle on the right.  
337102	  Sure thing. I'll put that in your cart.  
337103	  Sure, I'll add both of those to your cart now.  
337200	  Sure! How do you like this white chair in the back?  
337201	  The brown chair next to the striped rug in the back matches that criteria.  
337202	  The couch chairs on the far right are all options that match your style.  
337203	  Which chair do you mean?

337301	  Which one?  
337302	  Yes.  It is from Downtown Stylists and is $649.  
337303	  Sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I show you something different?  
337400	  Yes, how about the chair to the left of the red couch or the chair to the right of the red couch?  
337401	  Which one are you referring to?  
337402	  That one costs $99.99.  
337403	  Yes, that is the only one I have.  
337500	  Sure! What do you think of the wooden table on the right?  
337501	  What do you think of the black chair on the white rug on the bottom right or the white chair to the right of the partition.  
337502	  I have the black and white chair to the left of the partition, the black and white chair on the left side of the partition, and the brown chair to the right of the partition.  
337503	  Sorry, I don't have any items in this store that would match your criteria.  
337600	  What about these two ones?  
337601	  That is the only one we have like that.  
337602	  Sure thing!  
337603	  Certainly, the brown table in the front left has been added to your cart.  
337700	  How do you like this one?

337703	  It is priced at $499.  
337800	  Sure! What do you think of the white one on the left?  
337801	  Sorry, but I don't have anything matching those preferences.  
337802	  Ok, they are both made of wool. The blue rug has a rating of 4.8 and the white one is rated 4.3.  
337803	  Which one do you mean?  
337900	  I have three chairs in the center in the back.  
337901	  Sorry, but I don't have any more to show you.  
337902	  I am sorry but I cannot find any affordable options in those price ranges. Is there something else I can help you find?  
337903	  The brown chair is an affordable price, and the white chair is also expensive.  
338000	  How do you like this white chair in the back to the left?  
338001	  I don't happen to have any other brown chairs.  
338002	  Sorry, those are the only options available.  
338003	  Sorry, I don't see anything that matches your criteria.  
338100	  I have this black and white chair to the right, and a black one in the left corner. What do you think of them?  
338101	  Sure, the black and white one costs $499 and the brown one costs $399.  
338102	  The one on the right costs $399 and the one on the left costs $449.  
338103	  Those two chairs have similar ratings to each other.  
338200	  The blue chair in the middle of the room on the right would probably be in your style.  
338201	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything else to show you.  
338202	  The black and white chair is rated 2.9 and the brown chair has a rating of 3.6.  
338203	  Sure, I'll add one brown chair to your cart.  
338300	  What do you think of the wooden one or the brown one?  
338301	  Which one are you referring to?  
338302	  It's made of leather.  
338303	  Which one did you mean?  
338400	  I have the white chair to the left of the green chair, and the white chair to the left of the red chair.  
338401	  How about this blue chair across from the white sofa in the back?  
338402	  I'm sorry, I don't have any armchairs by River Chateau that you should take a look at.  
338403	  Of course.  I'll put it in your cart.  
338500	  There are two white rugs here.  
338501	  Sorry, but no other rug meets your search criteria.  
338502	  Okay, both items will be added to your cart.  
338503	  In the second display from the left on the left wall, I have the white couch chair and the white lamp.

338703	  I have this one white chair and another white one in the back left corner.  
338800	  Take a look at this white rug in the back.  
338801	  Alright, I will add both to your cart.  
338802	  Sure, how do you like the red and white chair up front or the white chair on the left?  
338803	  Of course. I'll do so now.

339003	  The one on the right has a 3.1 rating, and the one on the left has a 4.1 rating.  
339100	  Take a look at these white ones.  
339101	  No problem! I have two gray area rugs on the right side of the room that fit your search. What do you think?  
339102	  I don't have any rugs from River Chateau, nor anything that matches your search criteria.  
339103	  Okay. I'll put that in your cart for you.  
339200	  Sure, the blue one up front is just what I've been searching for!  
339201	  That white armchair is the only one available.  
339202	  Which one?  
339203	  Sure, those chairs are made of leather, and they both come with a 3.9 rating.  
339300	  Take a look at the white rug in the middle of the room on your left.

339402	  It is now in your cart.  
339403	  Will do.

339502	  I don't have anything like that.

339900	  What do you think of the wooden chair on the right?  
339901	  We only have those two, I'm sorry.  
339902	  I'm sorry, that is the only similar item we have.  
339903	  Great, I'll add those to your cart.

340302	  There's this black chair in the back right corner.  
340303	  Sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?  
340400	  How about the red rug in the front?  
340401	  I found a leather armchair in front of us, second from the left. It is a leather armchair.  
340402	  Will do! I will update your cart.

342003	  Sure, there's that rug in your cart right now.  
342100	  The brown chair at the far back would match nicely.  
342101	  I can suggest the brown chair on the light blue rug in the back, or the brown chair on the blue rug at the end.  
342102	  Sorry, those are the only ones I have.  
342103	  Sorry, I don't have anything meeting your criteria right now.  
342200	  I have this one right in front on the right side. What do you think?  
342201	  Adding to your cart now.

342403	  I don't have anything like that right now.  
342500	  What do you think about the wooden table in the back right corner?

382301	  I have these two end tables.  
382302	  Unfortunately I do not. Is there something else I can help you with?  
382303	  Which chair do you mean?  
382400	  Yes, how do you feel about this grey one?  
382401	  No, that's it for Rugs.

382403	  The table to the right is $399 and has a 3.6 rating. The one to the left is $449 and has a 4.0 rating.

382502	  In the back left corner of the room you can see a wooden table with a plain color. What do you think?  
382503	  Sure, I've added two more tables and chairs to your cart.  
382600	  What about these two grey ones?  
382601	  Which one?

382703	  Here's this white chair and this blue one on the other side of the rug. They both have the same brand.  
382800	  What do you think about the white chair in the middle of the room?  
382801	  I've got this brown one you see in the center and the other brown one on the striped rug.  
382802	  I'll put those in your cart.  
382803	  I found this table on the right in the very back.  
382900	  What do you think of the white chair at the back of the room?  
382901	  I'm sorry, we don't have anything else right now. Can I help you find anything else?  
382902	  Which ones?  
382903	  I will add both chairs to your cart.

383200	  Here's these two for you.  
383201	  Sorry, I can't find anything like that. Is there anything else I can do for you?  
383202	  Sorry, but I don't have anything else to recommend.  
383203	  There are two chairs on the right.  
383300	  I have this white chair in front on the blue rug.  
383301	  I found a white rug right in front of you on the round green rug.  
383302	  That rug is made of natural fibers.  
383303	  Which rug?  
383400	  There are several, yes.  
383401	  Yes, the color white is by Modern Arts, and the price is $449.  
383402	  Sorry, those are the only two chairs we have.

383500	  How about this wooden table on the back right?  
383501	  Which table are you referring to?  
383502	  That table is made from wood and has a 3.4 customer rating.  
383503	  Sorry, I don't have any tables from River Chateau from North Lodge.  
383600	  Sure, how do you like the grey one against the right side of the rug?  
383601	  That red couch chair and this blue one both look promising.  
383602	  Certainly!  I've updated your cart accordingly.

385000	  What do you think of this one?  
385001	  Sorry, but I don't see any other chairs made out of leather.  
385002	  Okay, it will be added.  
385003	  Sorry, nothing is currently available which matches your search criteria.  
385100	  I found these two tables for you.  
385101	  How about this one?

385402	  Of course, the chair by that wall is made of leather and costs $449.  
385403	  Certainly! These chairs are being added to your cart.  
385500	  How about the black chair at the end of the display  into the room?

385503	  Great, I'll put it in your cart for you.

386302	  Yes, I could do that!  If you're looking for the very first item from Art News Today, I'd also do that as well!  
386303	  No, I couldn't find any canvas hats matching that description.  
386304	  I'll update your cart.

437102	  The one on the right is a L and the one on the left is XS.  
437103	  Unfortunately, I don't have anything like that right now.  
437104	  Both of those jackets are available in XS and are from River Chateau.  
437200	  I can help you find a jacket today. Take a look at the grey jacket on the rack to the left and the brown one in the bottom row. They are both jackets.  
437201	  Sure! I have two nice options to show you. The black and white one hanging up high and center hanging above the other black and white blouse on the floor rack is what I can recommend.  
437202	  That black blouse and the white, red and violet one in the third cubby down from it would be quite brilliant! Please consider those options as well!  
437203	  I am sorry, which one did you mean?  
437204	  Great! I'll put those in your cart right away.  
437300	  Do you like this green one?

437801	  What do you think of the grey pair to the right of the mirror, or the brown pair on the left side of the wall?  
437802	  Sorry, but no items could be found which match your search criteria. What else can I help you find?

439104	  I don't have anything like that right now.  
439200	  What do you think of the grey one in the back to the left or the brown one to the right of it?  
439201	  I can't find anything by that brand.  
439202	  Which brown coat are you talking about?  
439203	  It's from StyleNow Feed.  
439204	  Okay, it will be added.  
439300	  Do you like the grey and white jacket on the rack? It is a jacket.  
439301	  Which pair?  
439302	  The light gray one is available in XL, M, L, XS, and XXL.  The blue one is available in L, S, M, XL, and XXL.  
439303	  Do you like the black jacket at the bottom of the left wall?  
439304	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I show you something different?  
439400	  There are two pairs of grey pants on the bottom row, the first is on the left and the second is hanging over the red shoeboxes.  
439401	  Ok. I will put those pants and that pair in your cart for you now.

439804	  Sure thing. I will add that pair of pants.  
439900	  Do you like the light blue pair in the back right cubby or either the blue or the grey ones in the front right cubby? They are both expensive jeans with good customer reviews.  
439901	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything matching those criteria.  
439902	  I have this hat on the right side of the garment rack and this black hat next to it.  
439903	  The brown coat is a small, and the grey one is a large.  
439904	  Ok. I will add those items to your cart now.  
440000	  What about these brown ones?

440002	  This one is an XL and costs $39.99.  
440003	  I have two coats with a plain pattern and good ratings.

440200	  Of course, I have a few options. In the fourth cabinet from the door is a violet shirt with a vertical design, and in the second cabinet from the door is a pink one with good ratings.  
440201	  Sorry, but I'm not sure which ones you're referring to. Could you be more specific?  
440202	  What do you think about the white top hanging up on the right?  
440203	  The blue one on the back left or the brown one next to it on the right fit what you are looking for. How do you feel about that?  
440204	  Got it! The blue and white shirt is now in your cart.  
440300	  How is this black one on the table?  
440301	  I apologize, but I don't have anything like that at the moment.  
440302	  I am very grateful. Both of the blue and white shirts you requested are now in your cart.  
440303	  Both shirts are plain colors. The blue one has a design in yellow with a 3.9 rating, and the white one has a design on grey with a 3.5 rating.  
440304	  Sure! I am adding both of those now.  
440400	  Do you like this black one on the top left? It is a striped tshirt.  
440401	  I'm sorry, I couldn't find anything like that. Can I get you something else?  
440402	  Sorry, nothing I found is matching those criteria.  
440403	  Sure, I'll add them now.  
440404	  Sure thing. I've added another one of each pair of jeans you've already seen.  
440500	  How about the two pairs on the left?  
440501	  Unfortunately I cannot find anything which matches your search criteria. Is there something else I might be able to assist you in?  
440502	  Okay, they will be added.  
440503	  Sorry, nothing matches that criteria.  
440504	  Sorry, but we don't have anything else like that. Is there something else I can do for you?  
440600	  How about the grey one in the back corner?

440603	  Sure thing.  
440700	  Do you like this brown one?

440702	  Take a look at this white area rug.  
440703	  Do you like the white chair on the right or the white chair just to the right of it?  
440800	  What do you think of the two brown coffee tables in the back.  
440801	  Sorry, I don't have any area rugs with a good rating from Uptown Studio.  
440802	  No problem. I'll add it to your cart for you.  
440803	  Ok, I'll put the lamp in your cart for you.  
440900	  What do you think of the brown chair to the left of the room divider and the brown chair to the right of that divider?  
440901	  Sorry, but no item meets your requirements. What else can I help you find?  
440902	  I can suggest the blue one on the left.  
440903	  Which chair are you referring to?  
441000	  How about the blue rug against the wall, or the blue rug on the right, both of which you might consider.  
441001	  Which one do you mean?  
441002	  This one is priced at $399.  
441003	  The gray one to the left of the gray one you already saw and the brown one next to it match your criteria.  
441100	  Sure! Let's start with the white rug in the front. We also have the white rug in the back left.  
441101	  I will put it in your cart now.  
441102	  Which one do you mean?  
441103	  This rug has a rating of 3.6.  
441200	  What do you think about this blue couch?  
441201	  Sorry, I don't have any at a reasonable price point.  
441202	  Sure, the couch is at an affordable price point, but also the ottoman near the blue couch costs $399.  
441203	  Sure, the grey sofa is made of leather, while the brown ottoman is made of wood.  
441300	  I can't find anything that matches your criteria.  
441301	  Sorry, I can't find anything that matches your criteria. What else can I help you with?  
441302	  Sure! What do you think of the brown one in the back?  
441303	  Sorry, nothing comes back from those searches.  
441400	  How do you like this grey coffee table?  
441401	  For which one?  
441402	  That table has a 4.4 customer rating.  
441403	  The left brown one, right above the brown hoodie is affordable, but nothing else fits that description.  
441500	  We've got three choices for you to choose from. There's a black one in the middle between the two rugs, another brown one at the right of the rug, and a blue one at the far end.  
441501	  Sure, a brown leather chair! I have this one, and the white one at the front of the table.  
441502	  Unfortunately, I cannot locate any tables made of leather in a high price range.  
441503	  The black table is an extreme price, at $549, with a wood finish. The white table is rated very highly, at 3.6, but is also made of leather and has a very high rating. Both tables are made of memory foam, with just the softcolored wooden finish hanging above them. The only tables like this are the table that have good customer ratings.  
441600	  I have this grey coffee table just to the left of the red couch.  
441601	  Okay, they will be added.  
441602	  Similar options are the two shelves just past the grey couch.  
441603	  Ok, I will add another brown coffee table to your cart.  
441700	  How about the white chair facing you on the red rug, or the other white chair to the right on the other red rug?  
441701	  Sorry, but nothing matches your search criteria.  
441702	  Ok, I will add it to your cart.  
441703	  How about the black chair in the far left corner, the white one in the left corner, or the brown chair with a wooden pattern to the right of it?  
441800	  Take a look at the grey sofa, the brown sofa, and the blue sofa. They are all sofa chairs.  
441801	  Sure thing, I'll add those to your cart.  
441802	  What do you think of the grey sofa?  
441803	  Sure thing, I'll add it to your cart.  
441900	  The wooden coffee table by the red rug would suit you.  
441901	  Sure thing.  
441902	  I'm sorry, I couldn't find any cheap leather sofa chairs.  
441903	  Sorry, but no item matches your search criteria.  
442000	  I see that you're looking for a high-rated sofa. Would you be interested in this grey sofa to your right?  
442001	  I'm sorry, I don't have other affordable couches.  
442002	  No problem. I have added both sofa to your cart.  
442003	  Sure thing! I am now adding those to your cart.  
442100	  Take a look at the brown and white striped shirt in the middle of the first top shelf in the back wall.  
442101	  What do you think about this white chair to the right of that one and this other white chair to the left of it?  
442102	  The left end has a 2.7 rating, and the right one has a 3.6.  
442103	  I'm sorry, which one did you mean?  
442200	  I have this brown chair in the far back.  
442201	  How about this grey sofa?  
442202	  Which one are you talking about?  
442203	  It has a rating of 3.7.  
442300	  I don't have anything like that either.  
442301	  Sorry, that's the only one.  
442302	  I have a white and gray one in the very back right.  
442303	  I'm sorry, I don't have any more chairs to show you like that. Can I help you with anything else?  
442400	  Sure, take a look at this grey one in the back left!  
442401	  They are both priced at $499.  
442402	  In addition to those two tables, I also have the white one beside the table on the rug behind the wall.  
442403	  Great! I'll update your cart for you.  
442500	  What do you think of the grey table on the blue rug?  
442501	  Unfortunately, the two coffee tables we have on this rug in front of the two black rugs have all shown good customer ratings.  
442502	  Yes, the two coffee tables are all from that brand.  
442503	  Of course, it's in your cart.  
442600	  Sure, there's a brown one directly in front of us.  
442601	  No problem!  I will add those tables to your cart right away!  
442602	  Sure, the white area rug in the back right corner matches your search, along with a few options at the front of the room to the left.  
442603	  Absolutely!  The table just to the right of the round shelves is the closest thing I have right now in stock, and the table just beyond that has a higher rating of 4.8!  
442700	  How about the white chair next to the table, or the brown chair in the corner of the room?  
442701	  I'm sorry, could you be more specific which item you're referring to?  
442702	  That one is $449.  
442703	  Of course, I'll put that in your cart.  
442800	  I have a brown coffee table in front of the divide on the green rug to the left.  
442801	  I found two in the back with good ratings. Do either of those look interesting?  
442802	  They are both made from leather and each is $349.  
442803	  I would suggest that the white coffee table in the back on the blue rug might be what you are looking for.  
442900	  Here's this white one.  
442901	  Unfortunately, nothing matches your search criteria.  
442902	  Awesome! I'll add both of those to your cart.  
442903	  I'm sorry, but I don't have anything else right now. Can I help you find something else?  
443000	  Do you like the white one on the left?

488103	  It's made from leather, and boasts a 4.4 rating.  
488200	  I think you might be pleased with that brown armchair on the right to the left of the lamp.  What do you think?

488703	  It's from Uptown Studio and is rated 4.4.

488901	  Those two lamps are the only ones I have in stock.  
488902	  I have the white rug facing the wall, and the grey rug further away from it.  
488903	  Which item are you asking about?  
489000	  Sure, take a look at the brown accent chair next to the grey couch.  
489001	  Of course, I will add it to your cart now.  
489002	  Sorry, I don't have anything like that.  
489003	  I'll add those to your cart.  
489100	  Sure, there's a white one over at the back right which might interest you.  
489101	  The black end table and the wooden table are both made of wood. They're both leather.  
489102	  Sure, all we have is the lamp on the right, actually.  
489103	  Great! You'll see those end tables in your cart in just a moment.  
489200	  There's one to the left of the wooden table.  
489201	  Which one?  
489202	  It costs $399.  
489203	  Sorry, nothing came up for you. What else can I help you with?  
489300	  Sorry, I couldn't find a match.

489302	  The grey and white couch chair to the left of the red couch in the front looks stunning.  
489303	  Sure, I will add that to your cart.  
489400	  There is one you might like and a white one.  
489401	  I'm sorry, we don't have any affordable area rugs by that brand.  
489402	  Which one do you mean?  
489403	  This rug is from River Chateau.  
489500	  What do you think about the two blue rugs?  
489501	  Which rug do you mean?  
489502	  The grey one is made out of metal and it has a 3.2 rating. The blue one is made out of wood and it has a 3.1 rating.  
489503	  Sorry, but no blue area rug could be found.  
489600	  In the back, I have the white accent chair, and in the front you'll see the white accent chair, and in the back right you'll see a white accent chair.  
489601	  Sorry, I can't find anything like that.  
489602	  Sorry, I don't see anything fitting your search. Is there anything else I can do for you?  
489603	  The only option that fits that description would be the black couch on the white rug.  
489700	  I have three couch chairs, one in the front left, one in the center, and another in the back. What do you think?  
489701	  Sure thing, adding that now.  
489702	  Those two are the only two similar tables.  
489703	  Sure, I'll add it.  
489800	  What do you think of the brown table at the back?  
489801	  That is the only wooden table with that color and price.  
489802	  Which table do you mean?  
489803	  It has a 3.1 customer rating.  
489900	  I've got the brown one on the white rug, the other one facing us on the white rug, and the other one to its left.  
489901	  How about this one to your left, or maybe the white rug to your right, or maybe the white rugs all the way to the far right?  
489902	  The table is $499 and the other is $449.  
489903	  Of course, I'll add those two rugs to your cart now.  
490000	  How do you feel about the white one over there?  
490001	  Which one?  
490002	  It has a 3.1 rating and is made of natural fibers.  
490003	  Unfortunately, there are no similar chairs with a good rating.  
490100	  There is the wooden table in the very back.  
490101	  Which ones?  
490102	  The wooden table has a 3.6 rating and the gray one has a 3.7 rating.  
490103	  Sorry, I don't have anything that matches your criteria.  
490200	  Do you like this white chair on the left, the white chair in front of it on the left, or the white chair to the right of the green rug?  
490201	  Take a look at this brown one and this white one.

490203	  Sure thing.  
490300	  I have this wooden one.  
490301	  The grey one has a 3.7 rating and is made by Uptown Studio, while the wooden one has a 3.1 rating and is made by North Lodge.  
490302	  They are both made of wood.  
490303	  Sorry, we don't have any other tables with good customer ratings from Art Den.  
490400	  Which rug do you mean?  
490401	  I couldn't find anything fitting that description.  
490402	  The rug in the front is from Home Store and the blue one is from Uptown Studio.  
490403	  Certainly.  I've added the rug to your cart.  
490500	  I've found these two chairs for you to look at.  
490501	  Take a look at that brown one on the right in the very back. It's a coffee table.  
490502	  Got it! I'll add those to your cart.  
490503	  Certainly!  
490600	  Do you like the white chair to the right of the blue chair, the brown one to the right of it, or the white chair to the left of the red one?  
490601	  Unfortunately, none of our current chairs come close to that, unfortunately.  
490602	  Sure thing.  
490603	  Unfortunately, I don't have anything in that color currently.  
490700	  Do you like either of the two white ones just to the left of the divide, or either of the two gray ones just to the right of that?  
490701	  The grey one has a 3.9 and the wooden one has a 2.9.  
490702	  I don't have any more lamps in grey, I don't have any other lamps to show you in a L.  
490703	  There's one on the far right of the room, in the near back corner of the room.  
490800	  How do you feel about this wooden table in the front?  
490801	  Sorry, nothing else. Anything else to help you find?  
490802	  Which one?  
490803	  That one is $399 and is made of wood.  
490900	  I've got the red rug in the back, the white one on the front side of the front wall, and the blue one just to the right of that.  
490901	  How about this wooden one?  
490902	  Sure thing.

491100	  There's the blue rug, the gray rug next to it, and the white rug further to the right.  
491101	  I have this table in the forefront of the set.  
491102	  Okay, they will be added.  
491103	  Okay, I will add another table to your cart in a moment.  
491200	  Yes, what do you think of that white one?  
491201	  Sorry, I don't have anything like that.  
491202	  I'm not sure which item you are asking about, as well as which sofa you are referring to. Could you please explain?  
491203	  Absolutely, I'll put that in your cart.  
491300	  I can offer you this grey rug at the bottom right of the room.  
491301	  I couldn't find anything else for your tastes.  
491302	  Certainly!  I'll add it to your cart.  
491303	  I'm so sorry, I couldn't find any blue rugs with high ratings.  
491400	  How about the wooden one to the right of the partition, or the other wooden one to the left of it?  
491401	  Sure thing, I'll add that for you now.  
491402	  I do, have the wooden table on the far right of the room and the brown table at the far left of the room.  
491403	  Of course, I'll put those two items in your cart for you.  
491500	  What about this blue one over at the back left?

491600	  What do you think of the white accent chair in the middle of the room?  
491601	  Sorry, I can't find anything else matching that description.  
491602	  There's a brown table and two white tables in the middle of the room which match your criteria.  
491603	  I have the gray accent chair and the gray sofa chair all the way at the back.  
491700	  Sure! I've got the brown one at the front right, the white chair directly across from it, and the other white chair closest to the grey rug.  
491701	  Sorry, I don't have any more items like that.  
491702	  The white couch with the long shelves on it would work for you.  
491703	  I'll put that in your cart.  
491800	  How about the blue rug right in front?  
491801	  Unfortunately, that's all I have. Is there something else I can do for you?  
491802	  I don't have anything to show you right now. Can I help with something else?  
491803	  There's a couple of wooden tables you might like that fit your style.  
491900	  I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any blue rugs. Is there something else I can do for you?  
491901	  How about the wooden table against the wall against the wall to the right?  
491902	  Unfortunately I do not have any tables like that.

492101	  What do you think of the two tables I just mentioned?  
492102	  Which end table?  
492103	  It is made by North Lodge.  
492200	  I have three for you.  
492201	  I don't have any rugs matching that description.  
492202	  Sure thing, I'll add it to your cart.  
492203	  Sure thing, both of them will be added to your cart.  
492300	  How about the white area rug to the right of the blue couch, the blue rug on the left, or the white area rug near the wall?

492400	  How about this blue one in the back on the bottom?  
492401	  Unfortunately, this is the only black chair by River Chateau.  
492402	  What do you think of the white chair towards the back right of the room?  
492403	  I think we can afford to have both of those in the same room together, or at least do so on our regular round-trip trip around the holidays.  
492500	  Here's this gray one.  
492501	  How about this brown one? It's from StyleNow Feed.  
492502	  Nothing I could find.

492903	  No problem. That wooden table to the left of the blue rug is from Downtown Stylists.  
493000	  Do you like either of these?  
493001	  What do you think about the white rug?

493200	  I can help with that. I have this wooden table to the left of the shelves on the back side of the room.  
493201	  How about this one on the left?  
493202	  Perfect, I'll put it in your cart.  
493203	  Sorry, I couldn't find anything that meets your specifications.  
493300	  Do you like either of the brown ones or the brown ones, either on the left or right?  
493301	  Sorry, but no.  
493302	  Okay, I'll add that for you now.  
493303	  Okay, adding those items now.  
493400	  How about this blue rug in front of the red sofa?  
493401	  I can show you a black leather chair. I have the one on the right.  
493402	  Alright. I'll do so now.  
493403	  I'll get that in your cart for you.  
493500	  How about the grey chair in the back corner?

493700	  How about the two brown tables to the right of the divider you were just talking about?  
493701	  Which items are you referring to?  
493702	  The one on the right is leather. The one on the left is a wood coffee table.  
493703	  Sorry, that is the only item that matches your preferences.  
493800	  Do you like either of the brown ones? They are chairs.  
493801	  Sorry, I don't have any other chairs.  
493802	  I've got this black one on the right as well as the black one up front.  
493803	  I am sorry but could you identify more precisely which one you are referring to?  
493900	  What do you think of this blue one?  
493901	  How do you like these two?

494301	  I couldn't find any rugs in wool.  
494302	  Certainly.  
494303	  Sorry I can't find anything with that criteria. Can I help you with anything else?  
494400	  There's the blue one in the middle, and the red one just beyond it.  
494401	  No, nothing at all I found.  
494402	  I don't have any highly rated black rugs, I'm sorry.  
494403	  I'll add that to your cart for you.

494800	  I have these two in the back right.  
494801	  That white accent chair in front of us, in the middle of the room on the left, might interest you.  
494802	  Sorry, I don't have anything with that style.  
494803	  Here's a coffee table made of wood that would match.  
494900	  What do you think of the two white ones and the brown chair over to the right?  
494901	  Which item do you mean?  
494902	  Sure, it comes in XS, S, M, and XL.

495103	  No, nothing I found matches those specifications.  
495200	  What do you think of the one to the right in the very back?  
495201	  That white chair and the two brown coffee tables you pointed out fit the bill.  
495202	  The wooden table is made of wood while the grey table is made of natural fibers.  
495203	  Sorry, that's all I have.  
495300	  How about these two?

530503	  They are both rated at 3.8 and are $249.  
530600	  How about the white chair on the left or the one just left of center in the middle?  
530601	  I have that white one in front of the red sofa, and the black and white one to the left of the white one.  
530602	  The ones you saw on the right are also from Modern Arts, leather, and have high customer ratings. They are both rated 3.8. The two in front of them are actually made of leather as well.  
530603	  In this case, I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that.  
530700	  Here's these two.  
530701	  Sorry, I don't see anything like that.  
530702	  Sure, take a look at the white one by the red sofa chair on the far end of the blue rug, and the white one by the red couch chair on the right.  
530703	  Okay, I'll add both of those now.  
530800	  I can do that for you! I have a grey chair on the center of the round patterned rug and another grey chair behind it. Do either of those appeal to your taste in furniture?  
530801	  Those two grey ones are the only options available.  
530802	  Similar items include the gray chair up front on the left, the black chair to the right, and the brown chair to the right.

531100	  How about the blue couch chair up against the wall or the white couch chair at the back of the room?

531400	  Sure, the blue chair in the back of the room on the blue rug meets your expectations.

531402	  I have a brown chair just beyond the sofa on the right, a white chair just behind it, and another brown chair on the left behind the white one. They are all cheap chairs.  
531403	  Ok, I'll put the two chairs in your cart for you.  
531500	  How about the brown sofa chair next to the red rug, or the grey one further away?  
531501	  I have this white one.  
531502	  I'm sorry, I didn't find anything else. Wanna search again?  
531503	  I don't have any more available. Can I help you find anything else?  
531600	  How do you like the white armchair next to the blue rug?

532200	  How about the blue one in the back right corner?  
532201	  They're both leather sofa chairs.  
532202	  Both would work well, except the grey one on the right. Do you like it?

532800	  How about the blue couch chair or the brown couch chair to the left of the brown one?

575002	  The wooden table has a rating of 4.8 and the brown one has a rating of 3.9.  
575003	  I'll add that now.  
575100	  Sure thing, I can show you one table right now.  
575101	  I found two brown tables in that partition and two on the right side of the partition.  
575102	  Sorry, which two are you referring to?  
575103	  Wonderful! I'll add the rug under the brown table to your cart.  
575200	  The table in the back has natural finishes, as does the wooden table at the front right.  
575201	  Of course, I'll add it to your cart.  
575202	  Which item would you like to know more about?  
575203	  Great, I'll update your cart with it.  
575300	  What do you think of the two grey rugs?  
575301	  Which rug are you referring to?  
575302	  This is a Modern Arts item and has a rating of 3.5.  
575303	  Sorry I don't.  
575400	  There's this brown table that matches your criteria.  
575401	  They are both rated 3.2.  
575402	  The wooden table has a 3.4 rating and is from StyleNow Feed. The brown one has a 4.0 and is from StyleNow Feed.  
575403	  Sorry, we don't have anything like that.

575501	  The table is from Modern Arts, and costs $399. The shelf is from StyleNow Feed.  
575502	  The one in the front costs $399 and the one in the back costs $249.  
575503	  The closer one is from Modern Arts and is made of wood. The other is from StyleNow Feed and is made of leather.  
575600	  How about this black one?  
575601	  The ones against the partition wall?  
575602	  Oh, the closest item to that would be that brown one to the right of that table.  
575603	  Which chair here would fit your decor?  
575700	  What do you think about the white rug in the back left?  
575701	  What do you think of the wooden table and the wood one?  
575702	  That one is more like it. The only difference is that this one has a very natural wood finish.  
575703	  No problem. I can suggest the brown table to your left, the wooden table to the right of it, or the brown table on the rug on the other side of that partition.  
575800	  I'm sorry, we do not currently have any affordable wooden tables in stock.  
575801	  Which shelves do you mean?  
575802	  Those are made of wood, and the customer rating for them is 3.9.  
575803	  What do you think of this white option on the left side of the display table?  
575900	  I have this wooden table in the back.  
575901	  Sorry, this is the only one we have.  
575902	  What do you think of these ones?  
575903	  I will add that table to your cart now.  
576000	  What do you think of the chair in front of the partition in the middle.  
576001	  The closest chair is the one on the left wall, but we also have another, we have another one on the far right and another on the back right in between the two shelves.  
576002	  How about this white one on the left?  
576003	  Great! I'll add the table and table to your cart for you.  
576100	  Of course, what do you think about the black chair on the right and the white chair to the left of that one?  
576101	  I can help with that. I have the grey bed up in the back and the white bed under the grey rug on the right.  
576102	  Yes, I'm talking about the grey rug you've already seen.  
576103	  Sorry, but nothing matches your search criteria.  
576200	  I have the black one on the left on the left.  
576201	  How about this chair in the middle and the brown chair to the right?  
576202	  Sure thing! I'll put that in your cart.  
576203	  Which one?  
576300	  How is this grey one on the right in the middle of the room, or the other grey one just to the left of it?  
576301	  I am sorry, but I couldn't find any beds with a good rating.  
576302	  Which one?  
576303	  This bed has a 3.4 customer review.  
576400	  Do you like this red one?  
576401	  That is the only rug available.  
576402	  Sorry, I don't have anything else like that.  
576403	  I'm sorry, could you specify which one you mean?  
576500	  I have a bed to show you.  
576501	  What do you think of the wooden shelves behind the bed.  
576502	  I didn't find any similar shelves to show you.  
576503	  Sure, I added them to your cart.  
576600	  I'm sorry, I don't have any affordable Bed Store beds.  
576601	  How about that wooden shelf in the back?  
576602	  Sorry, those are the only ones I have.  
576603	  Ok, I'll put them in your cart for you.  
576700	  What do you think of the wooden shelves by the gray rug?  
576701	  Which tables are you referring to?  
576702	  Both tables are made of wood.  
576703	  Ok, I'll add that to your cart now.  
576800	  How about the one on the bottom left?  
576801	  What do you think of this gray one?  
576802	  Which one?  
576803	  That table is made of wood.  
576900	  Do you like the brown table on the left or the brown one on the right?  
576901	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything similar to that right now. Can I get you something different?  
576902	  Sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I help you find something else?  
576903	  That table is the only one currently available with the same rating.  
577000	  I do! Take a look at this gray one on the right, or the white one in the back.  
577001	  Sure thing, I've added it for you.  
577002	  I'm sorry, that's the only rug I have that's wool.  
577003	  That's all for now.  
577100	  I have the one right in front of the red sofa, the one below it, and the one to the right of the second one.  
577101	  I apologize, but I don't have any expensive wooden shelves with a good customer rating.  
577102	  No problem. I'll add it to your cart.  
577103	  I'll put that in your cart for you.  
577200	  What do you think of this one in the back on the left?  
577201	  Unfortunately I don't. Wanna look for anything else?

577203	  Okay, I will add that right away.  
577300	  Sure, how do you like the brown table at the back of the room in the back?

577303	  Of course.  I'll add those to your cart for you.  
577400	  What do you think of the black end table on the right?  
577401	  Sure!  I have a white coffee table that might interest you.  The one to your left is made with memory foam.  
577402	  Which tables?  
577403	  They both come from Downtown Stylists and are rated 4.3.  
577500	  How about this one on the right side of the gray rug?  
577501	  What do you think of the shelves to the left?  
577502	  Just those two items.  
577503	  Okay, it will be added.  
577600	  How about the wooden table on the far right?  
577601	  I am confirming that purchase. The wooden table is now in your cart.  
577602	  They're both made of wood.  
577603	  Okay. I'll add that now.  
577700	  I have this brown one and this brown one in the center of the room.  
577701	  I'm sorry, I don't see anything like that. Can I help you find something else?  
577702	  I found nothing like that.  
577703	  The one between them is made of metal, and the one on the right is made of leather.  
577800	  I have two.  You can see one on the far left, one in the middle, and the second in the top row.  
577801	  What do you think of the grey shelves on the right?  
577802	  Which ones?  
577803	  They're rated 3.4.

577903	  Here's the one on the left.  
578000	  Here's one you might like: the gray rug in the back by the large wooden shelves.  
578001	  I'm sorry, I don't have any leather rugs.  
578002	  I sure can, I added that item to your cart.  
578003	  I'm sorry, could you be more specific?  
578100	  Sure, I've got the two grey sofa chairs in the leftmost cabinet.  
578101	  I'm sorry, we don't have any more sofa chairs in grey with the color you specified.  
578102	  Unfortunately, we have no affordable memory foam chairs with memory foam.  
578103	  Of course, the grey chair costs $349 and is rated 3.7.  
578200	  Take a look at the black table by the wood table.  
578201	  Here's these two brown tables on the right, a brown one with a good rating.  
578202	  I will do that now.  
578203	  Sorry, I do not. Can I show you anything else?  
578300	  How do you like this white one?  
578301	  Sorry, I can't find anything like that.  
578302	  This one is the only one we have.  
578303	  I'll put it in your cart.

578403	  What do you think of this one?  
578500	  I have these ones on the bottom right of the back wall. What do you think of them?  
578501	  Sorry, I don't have anything with that criteria.  
578502	  Alright, I'll add them for you.  
578503	  There is a blue pair on the bottom row to the left.  
578504	  Of course. They are being added to your cart.  
578600	  Take a look at the yellow shirt hanging up on the left wall, the blue one above it, and the black and white shirt hanging up on the far right wall.

656702	  I apologize, but there are no more blue area rugs currently in stock.  
656703	  Yes, the one in front of us is wood and has a 3.0 rating. The one behind it is a made of natural fibers and has a 2.8 rating.  
656800	  You may like that white area rug at the far end of the room.  
656801	  Take a look at the white chair on the rug and the black and white chair in the middle of the room.  
656802	  Adding to your cart now.  
656803	  Ok, I'll add it to your cart as well.  
656900	  How about the blue one in the very back?  
656901	  I have the brown one in front of you and another white one in the very back to the right.  
656902	  Which rugs are you referring to?  
656903	  The white rug is from River Chateau and the blue rug is from Modern Arts.  
657000	  Take a look at the grey one on the right, or the brown one just in front.  
657001	  Adding the couch chair.  
657002	  Sorry, which sofa chairs do you mean?  
657003	  Sure, they both have a 3.9 rating and are made of natural fibers.  
657100	  I have several red rugs on the left, what do you think?  
657101	  That is the only white area rug made of wool.  
657102	  I've got the brown option in front of the blue rug and the white sofa chair next to it.  
657103	  How about the blue one in back or the gray one in front? Both are wool.  
657200	  The one at the edge of the striped rug might interest you.  
657201	  Sorry, nothing I found was similar to what you're looking for. Would you like to continue shopping?  
657202	  Of course! What do you think of this blue area rug on the right side of the room?  
657203	  Sorry, which one?  
657300	  How about the brown chair in the back right set, or the white one that's on the left-hand wall in the center set?  
657301	  Sorry, but nothing matches your search criteria.  
657302	  Unfortunately, I cannot find any chairs by River Chateau that have good customer ratings.  
657303	  Just those two white ones.  
657400	  How about the white one to the left of the wooden table, or the white one to the right of that?  
657401	  The blue rug in the front left  on the blue rug might work, but there's also a white area rug in the back left corner.  
657402	  Unfortunately, there are no inexpensive area rugs.  
657403	  Okay, that rug will be added to your cart.  
657500	  Sure, what about the white sofa between the two beds?  
657501	  Which sofa are you referring to?  
657502	  Both of them are leather.  
657503	  The grey one is rated 4.9 and is made of leather.  
657600	  Do you like the brown one against the back wall?  
657601	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that at the moment. Can I find something else for you?  
657602	  I'm afraid not.  
657603	  Sure, I will add it to your cart.  
657700	  Take a look at the red sofa in the front, the grey sofa in the back, and the grey sofa in front of that sofa.  
657701	  Just that one.  
657702	  Of course, now you've got it! I'll add that chair and the rug for you now.  
657703	  That grey sofa is far from grey, unfortunately.  
657800	  How about these two grey ones?  
657801	  Which one?  
657802	  That is from River Chateau.  
657803	  Sorry, but I don't have anything like that.

657901	  In the middle of the room, I have the blue sofa chair, and the brown one in the back right.  
657902	  The one in the front is rated 4.0, made of metal and costs $399. The one in the back is rated 4.3, made of natural fibers and costs $399.  
657903	  Okay, that table will be added to your cart.

658001	  The white one is made from wood, the wooden one is made of wood.

658003	  I will add that to your cart.  
658100	  How about the white chair?  
658101	  Which one?  
658102	  It's $649.  
658103	  Which ones?  
658200	  I don't happen to have any affordably priced accent chairs.  
658201	  There is one in the back of the room and one on the right side of the floor stand. What do you think of them?  
658202	  Which one?  
658203	  It's from River Chateau.  
658300	  Sure! How about this one on the right?  
658301	  No problem, I've added it to your cart.  
658302	  I don't have anything else to show you.  
658303	  Sorry, which one?

711302	  Ok, that one is rated 2.9, and the one with the sleeves on the right is rated 3.4.  
711303	  Sorry, that's all I have in white.

711802	  The only similar items I have are the one against the wall on the left and that one against the wall to the right of that.

712303	  Which table are you referring to?  
712400	  What do you think of the white one up in the back?

712903	  The one against the wall is the only option available.  
713000	  The light brown coffee table in the middle of the room and the other brown one at the front of the room would make for a good addition to your ensemble.

713803	  Sorry I couldn't find any tables by North Lodge.  
713900	  What do you think of the blue rug?

714102	  Ok. I'll put those two in your cart for you.  
714103	  I'll put those in your cart as well.  
714200	  I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a couch made out of leather. What about that grey one in the back?  
714201	  The only two on that display, I think.  
714202	  Those two coffee tables are the only ones we have currently.  
714203	  Sure thing, I am adding them to your cart now.

714503	  Could you clarify which tables you're referring to?  
714600	  I can suggest the blue lamp on the blue rug.  
714601	  Which item are you asking about?  
714602	  This one costs $549 and comes from Modern Arts.

715003	  Not yet. Can I show you anything else?  
715100	  I don't have any cheap rugs, unfortunately.  
715101	  Sorry, I don't have any expensive area rugs.  
715102	  Sure, how about the two brown ones against the wall?

715501	  Of course.

724102	  How about the three against the wall at the back of the room?  
724103	  Sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I show you something else?  
724200	  What do you think of the grey bed on the red rug to your left?  
724201	  The only similar item would be the shelves in front of the room, the one to the right of the two others.

724502	  Sorry, that's the only rug we have like that.  
724503	  I don't have anything similar.  
724600	  The white rug in the back to the left is made of natural fibers from Uptown Studio.  
724601	  Sorry, nothing I found is similar. What else can I do for you?  
724602	  Which ones are you referring to?
