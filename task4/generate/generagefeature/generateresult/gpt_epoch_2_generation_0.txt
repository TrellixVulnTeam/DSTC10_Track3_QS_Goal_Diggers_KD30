68301	  In the left cabinet, I have that gray and white jacket hanging in the middle, as well as the blue jacket hanging up on the right wall.  
68302	  Unfortunately, I can't find anything like that. Can I get you anything else?  
68303	  Sorry, but nothing like that is available. Can I help you look for anything else?  
68304	  What do you think of the black coat to the left?  
68305	  There's a black coat hanging on the rack to the right, as well as a grey one next to that and a light grey one next to it.

68702	  I am afraid there are no items meeting these requirements.  
68703	  What do you think of the grey pants in the back or the other grey ones on the right?

72202	  I have one hanging up on the top right against the wall in the third cabinet.  
72203	  That has no customer reviews.  
72204	  I don't happen to have anything like that at the moment.  
72205	  In the cabinet closest to you, I have that gray blazer.  
72206	  That's the only gray one I have in L.  
72300	  No problem. Do you like the light grey option on the top left of the back wall, the blue one two to the right of it, or the grey and white option on the top right of the same wall?  
72301	  How about the dark green one on the table?  
72302	  Certainly! I am updating your shopping cart to include it.  
72303	  Unfortunately, there are no more sweaters in that size. Is there something else I can do for you today?  
72304	  I have the beige one in the second cubby from the left and the red and white one in the next cubby over.  
72305	  Of course! Check out the brown one on the bottom shelf of the table.

72400	  I have three options. There's a pair of dark green joggers to the left of the mirror, a pair of dark green joggers on the back wall, and a pair of dark green joggers on the right side of the counter.  
72401	  Sorry, I could not find anything else.

72605	  What do you think about the blue shirt in the left middle cubby of the right dresser?

151401	  Which items are you talking about?  
151402	  Those are the only ones I have.

151600	  I have two in the back and one on the right, do you like either of them?  
151601	  The one on the right is leather, while the one on the left is leather.

151900	  What about the grey sofa in the back?  
151901	  Which one?  
151902	  It's from Uptown Studio.  
151903	  I don't have anything like that available.  
152000	  How about the grey one in the back, the white one at the front of the room, or the white one at the front?  
152001	  Here is one.

152003	  Which one are you talking about?  
152100	  The brown chair in the back has a good customer rating.  
152101	  I cannot find anything that matches that search.

152103	  Both are rated 3.8.  
152200	  Unfortunately, we do not have any expensive brown chairs. Is there anything else I could help you find?

152202	  I can tell you that the other, white chair on the right is by Downtown Consignment, while the chair on the left is by Modern Arts.

152300	  How are these wooden shelves in the back to the left?  
152301	  Sorry, I don't have any shelves from that brand.  
152302	  The only other item similar to those tables is the table at the back right.

152502	  Great! I'll add those shelves to your cart.  
152503	  Of course, I'll put them in your cart.  
152600	  What do you think of the white chair in the far back right corner of the room?  
152601	  That coffee table by that brand, on the blue rug to the right, has the lowest  customerRating.  
152602	  Sure thing! I'll add those to your cart right away.  
152603	  Which ones?  
152700	  I think you may like the grey rug to the right of the blue chair or the white rug on the left.

196301	  I have another blue one just in front of you, and a smaller blue one in the back right. What do you think of those?

196502	  It's from 212 Local and is made of leather.  
196503	  I don't happen to have any wooden chairs from 212 Local.

196800	  Sorry, but I don't have any tables like that at the moment.  
196801	  Either one matches your search parameters.  
196802	  I have two wooden shelves, one in the back near the end of the display table and another in front of the white lamp.  
196803	  That is the only one I have right now.  
196900	  I have the two brown coffee tables on the blue rug to the left.  
196901	  I don't have anything like that, unfortunately.  
196902	  Sure thing.  
196903	  Certainly, I'll add that rug.  
197000	  Sure, we have a brown chair on the right side of the partition at the back on the right, as well as a black and white striped chair to the left of that one.

197102	  I'm sorry, which rug did you mean?  
197103	  Oh, yes! That rug is made by Home Store, and the price tag for it is $249.

197702	  Could you specify which rug you'd like to know the price of?  
197703	  Sure, what do you think of this one over by the red sofa?

201701	  Of course, I've added it to your cart.

201703	  Of course, I'll do so now.  
201800	  What do you think of the brown chair near the end of the rug?  
201801	  I think you may like the shorter shelf by the bookshelves to the left.

201803	  Could you specify which shelves you mean?  
201900	  What do you think of the tall shelves in the back?

229403	  Of course, I'll update your cart.

229502	  It has a rating of 3.2.  
229503	  The taller of the two is from StyleNow Feed and the shorter one is from Modern Arts.  
229600	  Take a look at the white ottoman just behind the brown sofa.  
229601	  Sorry, but I can't find anything like that. Is there something else you'd like my help with?  
229602	  I found a brown leather sofa chair you might like. It's the blue one.  
229603	  I'll get that information for you.  
229700	  Certainly! Have a look at the white one on the right or the beige one on the left.  
229701	  Those are the only two white accent chairs I have that are in the expensiveprice range.  
229702	  I'll add those to your cart for you.  
229703	  In the front left corner is a brown accent chair.  
229800	  I have the gray couch chair on the blue rug to the left, and the white couch chair at the corner of the blue rug.  
229801	  What do you think of the white couch chair to the left?  
229802	  Sorry, I couldn't find anything that matched that criteria.  
229803	  Could you specify which item you mean?  
229900	  Do you like the white sofa chair in front of us and the white couch chair on the left?

230001	  Both are leather, rated 3.5 and made by Modern Arts.  
230002	  Which chair are you asking about?  
230003	  That chair is made by Downtown Stylists.

230101	  The blue one is from Downtown Stylists and made of leather. The brown one is made from natural fibers and from Modern Arts.  
230102	  I have one on the left in the very back. Do you like it?  
230103	  Okay, I'll add those two items to your cart.  
230200	  I have two white sofa chairs and one black one to the right.  
230201	  Got it, I'll add both of those for you.  
230202	  Which table?  
230203	  It's rated at 4.4 and costs $399.  
230300	  What do you think about the grey sofa in the middle set of shelves?  
230301	  I'm so sorry, but there are no affordable tables made with that material.  
230302	  That end table has a customer rating of 3.4. The wooden end table has a customer rating of 4.9.  
230303	  For which chairs?  
230400	  What do you think of the white armchair to the right?  
230401	  I'm sorry, I can't find anything that matches that criteria.  
230402	  How about the blue sofa right next to the brown chair or the blue one in the center of the room?  
230403	  I don't have any that fit that criteria.  
230500	  I don't have any blue ones on the expensive end, sorry.  
230501	  I couldn't find anything matching that criteria.  
230502	  Great, I'll put two of that in your cart.  
230503	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything else like that at the moment. Can I get you something else?  
230600	  There's two white armchairs, both of which fit what you're looking for.  
230601	  The one on the left costs $499, and the one on the right costs $349.  
230602	  Which of these chairs do you mean?  
230603	  That is a leather chair with a price tag of $649.  
230700	  The brown sofa in the back may interest you, and the grey one on the front left would all the rage.  
230701	  Unfortunately, that is the only item which fits your description.  
230702	  I'm afraid which chairs you're inquiring about?  
230703	  No INFORM:DISAMBIGUATE  At the moment, those are all I have for leather couch chairs from Downtown Stylists in stock.  
230800	  How about this grey one on the white rug in front?  
230801	  Which end table are you referring to?  
230802	  That white one is rated 4.2 and made of wood.  
230803	  Aside from the white one on the left, there's a brown chair right in the middle of the room, and another brown chair right up front on the right.  
230900	  If you see any of those, I have a brown chair right next to it, as well as a white armchair directly in front of you on the red rug.  
230901	  Unfortunately, I do not see any leather armchairs.  
230902	  They're both $399 from Modern Arts.  
230903	  Could you be more specific please?  
231000	  How about the one on the blue rug?  
231001	  How do you like these ones?  
231002	  The one on the right is from StyleNow Feed, has a 3.2 rating and costs $399. The one on the left is from River Chateau, has a 3.6 rating and costs $399.  
231003	  How do you like this brown one? It has a nice leather look.  
231100	  How about this white one?  
231101	  Can you be more specific?  
231102	  The blue chair is leather and is made of leather, while the brown chair is made of wood and is made of leather.  
231103	  No, I can't find anything that matches. Wanna search again?  
231200	  How about the one by the shelves?  
231201	  I have one sofa chair you might like. It's the blue one.  
231202	  Sure thing, I'll add it.  
231203	  I have the red one in the back to the left, the blue one right next to it, and the brown one in the front just past the white couch chair.  
231300	  Take a look at the grey sofa in the far back right.  
231301	  Unfortunately, I have no sofa chairs in stock that match all of your criteria.  
231302	  They are both made by 212 Local.  
231303	  Adding now!  
231400	  How about the black and white one in the middle?  
231401	  I apologize, but there are no chairs in blue which satisfy these requirements. Is there something else I can help you find?  
231402	  No, I don't have anything that fits that description. Can I help with something else?  
231403	  I'll update your cart.  
231500	  What do you think of the brown sofa in the back?  
231501	  How about the white chair next to the grey sofa and the white chair that is further back?  
231502	  The only item that would fit these parameters would be the brown chair in the back.  
231503	  You got it. I will add that white end table for you now.  
231600	  I have found a white chair with good ratings, as well as a grey chair to the right of the lamp in the back.  
231601	  The blue chair is one of a kind, has a good rating, and is offered in all sizes from extra small to extra extra large. The brown chair is also inexpensive and has high ratings.  
231602	  Both of those end tables cost $399.  
231603	  These three white chairs you just looked at are all highly rated.  
231700	  What do you think about the blue chair in front of the red couch?  
231701	  How do you like this sofa?  
231702	  Which sofa are you referring to?  
231703	  It is from Modern Arts and is made of leather.  
231800	  I have these three.  
231801	  Sorry, I don't have any leather chair that meets those preferences.  
231802	  Sure thing, I'll add that to your cart.  
231803	  Sorry, nothing matches those search parameters.  
231900	  You might fall in love with the red one against the wall on the right, the gray one in the very back, or the white end table on the right.  
231901	  The gray sofa at the front of the room meets that description.  
231902	  Sure, which chair are you looking at?  
231903	  I'm sorry, which one did you mean?  
232000	  There's a brown chair in the far right display that you might like.  
232001	  No, just those two in the middle of the room.  
232002	  Sure! It's in your cart now.  
232003	  I'm sorry, I don't have any ones like that.  
232100	  Sure, what do you think of the grey one on the right?  
232101	  I apologize, but there are no grey sofas for sale by Modern Arts.  
232102	  Certainly, I have that information for you. Both tables cost $399 and each have similar customer ratings.  
232103	  I'll be happy to help! I'll get those lamps and that lamp in your cart for you now.  
232200	  There's a grey one and a brown one.  
232201	  Which one?  
232202	  It has a rating of 3.4.  
232203	  The white one is leather from Modern Arts, and the other one is made of wood from Uptown Studio.  
232300	  I found a white ottoman and a blue chair.  
232301	  Which one do you mean?  
232302	  It is $399 and by Downtown Stylists.  
232303	  Sorry, we don't have anything else to show you.  
232400	  I would suggest the white armchair and the white bench chair.  
232401	  Perfect! I'll add that to your cart.  
232402	  Which item are you referring to?  
232403	  It's leather.  
232500	  I suggest the long white arm chair in the back of the room or the white arm chair on the other side of the divide.  
232501	  They both have a rating of 3.7.  
232502	  You may like the blue and brown chairs, the ones in the back, or the brown one. They fit your preferences.  
232503	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that right now.  
232600	  How about this blue chair in front of the room divider?  
232601	  What do you think of the three sofa chairs in the display on the right?  
232602	  Which chairs do you mean?  
232603	  Great, I'll add that to your cart.  
232700	  Sure, what about the blue sofa chair at the far back of the room to the left?  
232701	  Of course, I've added it to your cart.  
232702	  Sorry, could you clarify which ones you mean?  
232703	  Sorry, could you clarify which sofa chair you're asking about?  
232800	  Sure, what do you think of the grey sofa in the far back?  
232801	  Which sofa are you asking about?  
232802	  It is $399 with a price tag of $399.  
232803	  I apologize, but I cannot find any item that satisfies that criteria. Is there anything else I can help you with?  
232900	  What do you think of the black chair?  
232901	  Both have a rating of 4.4.  
232902	  Sorry, but that's the only brown chair we have.  
232903	  I'm sorry, which one did you mean?  
233000	  Here are these three.  
233001	  Unfortunately, there is no item like that. Is there anything else I can do for you today?  
233002	  They are both leather sofas.  
233003	  Okay. I'll add them both to your cart.  
233100	  How about the grey sofa in the back on the left?  
233101	  I'm sorry, I could not find another grey sofa.  
233102	  Those are both made of wood.  
233103	  It will be added to your cart.  
233200	  How about the grey sofa in the back on the left?  
233201	  Certainly, I will add it now.  
233202	  Which one do you mean?  
233203	  That one is made from leather and made by Modern Arts.  
233300	  Do you like this white one? It is a chair.  
233301	  I cannot find anything that fits your search.  
233302	  Unfortunately, I do not see any that match your search criteria. Is there anything else I can help you with?  
233303	  Could you specify which chair you are referring to?  
233400	  Sure, over on the right you can see a brown armchair just beyond the red couch, a little further back there's another brown option further down the room, and a little further back to the right is a white ottoman.  Do any of those interest you?  
233401	  I'm sorry, we don't have anything that fits that description.  
233402	  Got it, adding the brown chair for you.  
233403	  Certainly, I've added one sofa and one couch chair to your cart.  
233500	  Do you like this blue one on the left? It is a armchair.  
233501	  I don't have anything that fits all those criteria.  
233502	  The brown chair I showed you would also work, as would the blue one on the right.  
233503	  Alright, I'll put them in your cart for you.  
233600	  There is a brown sofa chair and a blue sofa chair which match your criteria.  
233601	  Which sofa chairs are you talking about?  
233602	  Yes, there are several. Take a look at the white sofa chair to the left, the blue sofa chair to the right of the brown sofa chair, and the white sofa chair to the left of the blue sofa chair.  
233603	  Okay, I will add two of the blue sofa chairs to your cart.  
233700	  I have this white one up front and the white one on the other side of the divider.  
233701	  Sorry, nothing comes up that matches those preferences.  
233702	  For which one?  
233703	  Oh dear, it looks like it doesn't have an price tag of $349.  
233800	  I couldn't find anything with that description.  
233801	  Which ones?  
233802	  The white end table has a 3.4 rating and the black one has a 3.2.  
233803	  I have the white couch right next to the gray sofas you just looked at.  
233900	  How about the grey couch in the center?  
233901	  Those end tables are the only ones I have.  
233902	  I don't have anything like that.  
233903	  Do you like the white couch in the back or either of the white end tables along the side of the room? They are all couch chairs.  
234000	  We have three to choose from.  
234001	  I don't have anything else to show you.  
234002	  Ok, I'll add those to your cart.  
234003	  No problem! I'll add two more chairs to your cart right away.  
234100	  Sure, what do you think of the grey sofa in the far back?  
234101	  Sorry, which item are you referring to?

234103	  What about this grey one?  
234200	  Unfortunately, I do not have anything like that. Is there anything else I can help you find?  
234201	  You've got it. Adding now.  
234202	  Sadly, I have nothing else by StyleNow Feed, aside from the brown chair.  
234203	  Which ones do you mean?  
234300	  How about that grey sofa on the left and the one to the right of it?  
234301	  The brown chair and the white chair are both made by Downtown Stylists.  
234302	  The blue chair is made by Downtown Stylists and the brown chair is made by Modern Arts.  
234303	  Sorry, I couldn't find anything that matched that description. Is there anything else I can help you with?  
234400	  How do you like the grey sofa?  
234401	  Sorry, I don't have any leather sofas.  
234402	  Ok. I will add it now.  
234403	  Sorry, nothing matches your search criteria.  
234500	  What about the black and white chair to the right of the table on the right and the brown chair next to it?  
234501	  They're both made of leather, and rated 4.2.  
234502	  How about the gray one at the back?  
234503	  I'm sorry, but I couldn't find anything like that.  
234600	  At the front of the left partition, I have the long beige armchair at the edge of the rug, and the one further back on the white rug.  
234601	  That's it for leather barrel chairs.  
234602	  In the front, I have the blue pair in the middle of the round set.  
234603	  Okay, I'll update your cart with the brown chair.  
234700	  How about the blue sofa chair in the front, the white one next to it, or the grey one in front?  
234701	  How about the sofa chair on the left, to the right of the chair on the right?  
234702	  Which one?  
234703	  It is from Modern Arts and made of leather.  
234800	  We have these three white ones in the middle of the display room on the right, as well as the green one on the left-hand side of the room. Would any of these interest you?  
234801	  Okay. I will add both of those chairs to your cart now.  
234802	  The brown chair is made by Modern Arts, and those customers are generally more happy with their purchase.  
234803	  The brown one is by Downtown Stylists, has a customer rating of 4.7 and is made of leather, whereas the blue one is made of natural fibers, has a customer rating of 4.4 and is made of leather.

235002	  It's leather and by Uptown Studio.  
235003	  No problem. I'll put that in your cart for you.  
235100	  I have the grey sofa at the front and the grey one next to it.  
235101	  Certainly! I will add that sofa to your cart.

235203	  Which one do you mean?  
235300	  How about the grey one right in front of us?  
235301	  Sorry, nothing else matches your search parameters.  
235302	  Okay, the grey sofa chair will be added to your cart.  
235303	  Okay, they will be added.  
235400	  The white armchair closest to you is made by Downtown Stylists.  
235401	  How about the grey sofa in front of the red sofa?  
235402	  That grey sofa chair, the blue sofa chair and the grey sofa chair are all we have.  
235403	  Which items are you referring to?  
235500	  You may want to look at the white couch chairs between the two beds against the back wall.  
235501	  I apologize, but I couldn't find anything that matched your search criteria.  
235502	  I'm afraid I don't have anything else that matches your description.  
235503	  Okay, great! I'll add that to your cart.  
235600	  I have two like that.  
235601	  Which one?  
235602	  It's leather and rated 3.5.  
235603	  Sorry, I don't see any leather chair today.  
235700	  How about the grey sofa in the back and the one in the middle of the blue rug?  
235701	  Sorry I couldn't find anything.  
235702	  I'm sorry, I'm not sure which one you mean.  
235703	  Alright, adding it to your cart now.  
235800	  I found two white ones on the right and the blue one on the left.  
235801	  Which two are you referring to?  
235802	  In addition to the two in the center, there's another blue one just beyond that to the left.  
235803	  Ok, I'll put it in your cart for you.  
235900	  What do you think of the white couch chair to the left, the white couch chair at the far back, or the white couch chair to the right?  
235901	  Sorry, nothing matches your criteria.  
235902	  What do you think of the grey sofa? It is made of grey and that is the only grey sofa chair.  
235903	  Okay, I will add that couch chair to your cart.  
236000	  Here's this one.  
236001	  I'm sorry, which one?  
236002	  The one on the left costs $349 and the one on the right is $499.  
236003	  Unfortunately, we don't have any sofas in this style.  
236100	  I have the black dress hanging on the back right of the wall, the black dress hanging on the front left of the center rack, and the purple dress hanging on the right side of the front rack.  
236101	  What do you think about this purple dress on the center-left top shelf, and the black one on the center-right top shelf?  
236102	  What do you think about this brown one on the left end of the top shelf?  
236103	  Sure thing.  
236104	  Sorry, I can't find anything matching those criteria. Can I help with something else?  
236200	  I don't happen to have any affordable dresses.  
236201	  I've got the dark blue ones in the third cabinet from the door.  
236202	  The light blue ones second from the left and the light blue ones third from the left.  
236203	  I'm sorry, I don't have any similar items.  
236204	  The ones on the right cost $164.99 and have a 4.5, the ones in the middle cost $139.99 and have a 3.6 rating.  
236300	  I can suggest the pink sweater on the right in the top row and the red and white sweater on the left in the bottom row.  
236301	  Sorry, I can't find anything that matches those criteria.  
236302	  How about the two grey pairs in the cubbies second from right in the third shelf?  
236303	  I will add it to your cart for you.  
236304	  I will add both items to your cart.  
236400	  I don't have anything like that.  
236401	  I have the black one hanging up in the second cubby from the right.  
236402	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?  
236403	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something else?  
236404	  Okay, I'll put that in your cart for you.  
236500	  Check out the blue shirt hanging on the wall in front of you.  
236501	  Great! I'll add that shirt to your cart right away.  
236502	  Which hoodie are you interested in?  
236503	  I'm so sorry, but there are no hoodies with those attributes.  
236504	  Okay, I have a few blue hoodies, as well as a green one. What do you think?

335001	  The closest option of that would be the brown lamp further in the back.  
335002	  We have one other white wool rug in the middle of the room and the one closer to you that has a good rating.  
335003	  The one on the right has a higher rating at 4.9 and is made of leather, while the one on the left has a rating of 3.5 and is made of leather.  
335100	  Sure, in addition to the two we just showed you, there's a nice brown one in the front of the room and a brown one to the left of that.  
335101	  Sorry, I don't have any black and white tables.  
335102	  Sure, the price is $549, and the rating is 3.2.  
335103	  OK.  I'll add the rug to your cart.  
335200	  How about the brown chair between the beds on the right?  
335201	  They are both lamps made of metal.  
335202	  What do you think about the brown wooden table in the center of the room?  
335203	  Sorry, I couldn't find anything like that. Is there anything else I can get you?  
335300	  Sure, how do you like the gray rug on your left?  
335301	  Sure, I have two grey options along the right side.  Are you interested in either of those?  
335302	  Of course!  The one on the left is from Downtown Stylists.  It has a 3.2 rating, and costs $349.  The one on the right is from Modern Arts with a 4.2 rating.  It costs $349.  
335303	  Of course!  It will be in your cart in just a moment.  
335400	  Sure, what do you think of the brown chair in the back right set?  
335401	  Great, I will add that to your cart now!  
335402	  Yes, which chairs?  
335403	  The one on the left is rated 4.7, while the one on the right is rated 2.9.  
335500	  How do you like this grey one?  
335501	  I couldn't find anything else like that.  
335502	  Sure thing.  
335503	  Sorry, I couldn't find any other area rugs with brown.  
335600	  How about the white one or the black one in the back?  
335601	  Which ones?  
335602	  Sure, they're both $449 and rated at 4.7.  
335603	  The brown chair has a 4.2 rating and costs $599. The white chair has a 4.2 rating and costs $349.  
335700	  Take a look at the brown table by the shelves and the other brown one in the far back.  
335701	  Well aside from the lamp itself, I can offer you the lamps to the right of the partition wall.  
335702	  Both are made of natural fibers.  
335703	  Which items do you mean?  
335800	  What do you think about the white chair or the brown chair?  
335801	  Could you clarify which chair you are referring to?  
335802	  It's from Modern Arts and costs $349.  
335803	  I don't have anything like that. Can I help you with something else?  
335900	  Sure, the brown chair by Modern Arts would fit the bill!  
335901	  Certainly!  I'll add those items to your cart now.  
335902	  Sure, the shorter brown chair in the back under the red sofa is also a nice option.  
335903	  Which table are you asking about?  
336000	  On the left side of the room on the right side of the rug in the middle is a white rug that you might like.  
336001	  Could you specify which chair you're interested in?  
336002	  It's made of leather and retails for $649.  
336003	  Of course.  
336100	  How about the wooden one at the front right of the display?  
336101	  How do you like the white rug in the back left corner?  
336102	  Ok! I'll update your cart to include that rug.  
336103	  I'll add those to your cart too.  
336200	  Sure, what do you think of the black chair right in front of the grey one.  
336201	  Sure, there's a table right up front here.  What do you think?  
336202	  That blue rug is from them, as is the white one between the blue rugs you already saw.  
336203	  I wasn't able to locate any other blue rugs in the $399 range.  
336300	  How about the white arm chair across from that blue one?  
336301	  For which item?  
336302	  That is a Downtown Stylists leather chair from Modern Arts.  
336303	  The only one like it is the other black and white one you already saw.  
336400	  Do you like the wooden one in the back? It is from Modern Arts.  
336401	  Which ones?  
336402	  Both have a 3.2 rating.  
336403	  I don't have anything that fits your search.  
336500	  I can recommend the red rug in the middle of the room, as well as the grey one right in front of it.  Both of those are by River Chateau.  
336501	  Sorry, which rug do you mean?  
336502	  Both rugs are now in your cart.  
336503	  Sorry, which item are you referring to?  
336600	  How about the wooden table on the other side of the partition?  
336601	  That's the only item I have right now like that.  
336602	  The wood table on the right is a $649 item, while the table on the left is a $399.  
336603	  I'm sorry, but I don't have any chairs like that at this time.  
336700	  How do you like the gray rug under the red sofa or the blue rug in front of it?  
336701	  No, those are the only two rugs which match your criteria.  
336702	  What do you think about the white chair right in front of you, or maybe the grey one to the right of that white one?  
336703	  Yes, the white rug in the back fits that description.  
336800	  There's one in the back and another facing us, both of them white.  
336801	  I'm sorry, I don't have any tables made of natural fibers.  
336802	  How about this red one at the top left of the table?  
336803	  Which item do you mean?  
336900	  I found a wooden table way at the back of the room.  
336901	  In the back of the room, I have the white chair at the front left of the room, and the white one directly next to the dividing wall.  
336902	  Certainly, I've added both to your cart.  
336903	  Similar to that black and white chair, I also have the white one next to the brown one you added to your cart, and the other white chair to the left of that one.  
337000	  Sorry, I can't find anything matching that description.  
337001	  That chair has a good rating. Customers have given it a 4.4 rating!  
337002	  Oh, what do you think of it?  
337003	  Sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?  
337100	  The black and white chair on the right is black and white.  
337101	  Take a look at the brown one on the left.  
337102	  Sure thing.  
337103	  Okay, I'll add both of those to your cart for you.  
337200	  Sure! How do you like the white couch chair on the right?  
337201	  The chair at the front has favorable reviews, as does the other brown one on the left.  
337202	  The couch chairs on the left and right would fit well with your style.  
337203	  Which one do you mean?  
337300	  I have three white accent chairs in this room. What do you think?  
337301	  Which one?  
337302	  Sure.  It is from Downtown Stylists and retails for $399.  
337303	  Unfortunately, I have no accent chairs in that price range.  
337400	  Of course, how do you like the white one to the right of the lamp?  
337401	  Which one are you referring to?  
337402	  Oh, sorry, that is $109.99.  
337403	  Sorry, we don't have any like that.  
337500	  Take a look at the brown table in the back right, the brown table on the left, and the table next to the circular table.  
337501	  That black and white one in the back right corner might be just what you're looking for.  
337502	  I have the black and white chair in the center of the table, the black and white chair on the left side of the table, and the white chair in the back.  
337503	  Sorry, I don't have any leather leather chairs by Downtown Stylists.  
337600	  What do you think of the blue one and the brown one?  
337601	  I have two that might interest you.  
337602	  Sure thing, I'll add that sofa chair to your cart.  
337603	  Absolutely, I have this brown table at the back left of the room.  
337700	  How do you like these two?  
337701	  I don't have anything else from Modern Arts with a good rating.  
337702	  Which item would you like this information on?  
337703	  It is priced at $399.  
337800	  Take a look at the chair in the back.  
337801	  Sorry, which one?  
337802	  Ok, they are both made of wool and have a rating of 4.4.  
337803	  Which one do you mean?  
337900	  I have three chairs in your preferred color: the white one between the beds, the white chair on the left side of the divide in front of the lamp, and the black and white armchair next to it.  
337901	  Sorry, but nothing matches your search criteria.  
337902	  I apologize, but there are no similar items that match your criteria. Is there something else I can help you find?  
337903	  The white armchair is very expensive, at $449. The brown chair on the left has a high rating at 4.1, as does the brown armchair on the right on average.  
338000	  How is this brown chair in the very back?  
338001	  I'm sorry I can't find any other chairs.  
338002	  Sorry, those are the only options available.  
338003	  Sorry, I can't find anything that matches that criteria.  
338100	  I have this black one with two ottomans in the back and the brown one next to it.  
338101	  Sure, the black and white one costs $499 and the brown one retails for $349.  
338102	  Sure, the black and white one retails for $649 and the brown one retails for $349.  
338103	  Those two chairs are the only ones we have that match your criteria.  
338200	  The blue chair in the middle of the room on the right would look great with that style.  
338201	  I'm sorry, I don't have any other pieces with a good customer rating.  
338202	  The black and white chair is rated 2.9 and is by Downtown Consignment. The brown chair is rated at 4.9 and is by Modern Arts.  
338203	  Sure! I'll add these chairs to your cart for you now.  
338300	  What do you think of the wooden one at the back by the wood table?  
338301	  Which one are you referring to?  
338302	  It's made of leather.  
338303	  It was rated at 3.2 and by Modern Arts.  
338400	  The black and white chair in the middle of the room on the red rug might interest you.  
338401	  Sure, I have two blue chairs by River Chateau: the long one to the left on the green rug, and another long white one to the left of it.  
338402	  I've got this brown armchair at the left side of the screen on the left, and the other brown armchair at the top of the room.  
338403	  No problem.  I'll put it in your cart.  
338500	  What about the red rug in the back?  
338501	  Sorry, but no other rug meets your search criteria.  
338502	  Okay, they will be added to your cart.  
338503	  There is a white couch chair on the left you might like. What do you think?  
338600	  Take a look at this one.  
338601	  Sorry, which item are you talking about?  
338602	  It's made by Coats & More.  
338603	  That's the only one I have with those parameters.  
338700	  Sure, how about this blue rug?  
338701	  Sorry, I don't have anything like that.  
338702	  Of course, the white end table and brown chair are now in your cart.  
338703	  I have this one brown chair and another brown one in the back left corner.  
338800	  Take a look at this white one.  
338801	  Alright, I will add both to your cart.  
338802	  Of course, how do you like the brown chair up against the wall?  
338803	  Great, I'll put the rug in your cart for you.  
338900	  Do you like the white one in front of the brown table?  
338901	  Okay. I've added those to your cart.  
338902	  Which ones?  
338903	  Those are the only two similar rugs I have at the moment.  
339000	  How about this black and white chair?  
339001	  Sorry I can't find others.  
339002	  How do you like these three chairs?  
339003	  The one on the right is $349 and the right is $349.  
339100	  Take a look at this rug on the left.  
339101	  The only other option that matches your description is the white rug with the wooden tables next to it.  
339102	  I don't have any rugs from River Chateau, nor does the blue one.  
339103	  Got it. Adding now.  
339200	  Sure, the blue rug over to the right is actually blue.  
339201	  That white armchair is the only one similar to it.  
339202	  Which one are you talking about?  
339203	  Sure, those chairs are made of leather, and they both cost $349.  
339300	  Take a look at the white rug in the middle and the rug right behind it.  
339301	  Sorry, we don't.  
339302	  Which chair are you referring to?  
339303	  It's from Downtown Stylists.  
339400	  What do you think about the wooden table on the left?

339403	  You will see it in your cart in a moment.  
339500	  I have a blue rug in the back that may work for you.  
339501	  They're both from North Lodge and made of wool.  
339502	  I'm sorry, but I don't have any items like that.  
339503	  Sure thing.  
339600	  How about the one by the red sofa?  
339601	  The white couch chair is made of leather and the brown one is made of leather.  
339602	  I'll add it to your cart.  
339603	  No, the only thing else is the brown chair you just added.  
339700	  There's a white one in the front to the left, or a black one to the left of it.  
339701	  Which ones?  
339702	  Okay, I've added it to your cart.

339900	  Do you like either of the brown chairs on the right?  
339901	  These are the only two that match your description.  
339902	  Sorry, I don't have anything that fits those requirements.  
339903	  I will add both of those to your cart.  
340000	  Sure, I can help you find a brown sofa chair. What do you think of the one on the right side on the blue rug?  
340001	  Sorry, but I don't have anything matching that description.  
340002	  Sorry, which lamps are you asking about?  
340003	  No, they're actually both $549 and each from Global Voyager.  
340100	  How about the white one in the back or the white one in front?  
340101	  I don't have any others in the low rung on the back left or a good rating.  
340102	  I have these three sofa chairs in white, one on each side of the room.  
340103	  Perfect! I will add these to your cart for you.

340201	  Okay, doing so now.  
340202	  There is a black and white chair on the right that matches your criteria.  
340203	  Okay, I will add those to your cart.  
340300	  I'm sorry, I don't have any expensive rugs with good customer ratings.  
340301	  I'm sorry, I don't have any area rug similar to this one that's expensive and by Downtown Stylists.  
340302	  I have this black chair in the back right corner.  
340303	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that either.  
340400	  How about the red rug in the very back, the red rug in the front, or the other red rug in the middle?  
340401	  I found a leather armchair in front of us, next to a grey couch.

340403	  Certainly, I will do that now!  
340500	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?

340503	  Sorry, which one?  
340600	  How about the white couch chair in front of us on the left and the grey one facing us on the right?

340603	  Sorry, I don't.

340702	  Which rug are you asking about?  
340703	  It's made out of wool.

340900	  I have this brown table at the back right.  
340901	  Unfortunately, that's the only one.  
340902	  Sure thing.  
340903	  Sorry, I can't find any coffee tables by Modern Arts in brown by Modern Arts.  
341000	  How about this blue one in the back left corner?  
341001	  I'm sorry. I have nothing in stock like that. Can I help with something else?  
341002	  Which one?  
341003	  It has a rating of 3.1 and costs $349.  
341100	  Do you like the one on the right side of the round table, the white one in the middle of the blue rug, or the white one on the white rug to the left?  
341101	  I'm sorry, I don't have any other chairs available.  
341102	  Yes, how about the brown one on the right? It's a brown one.  
341103	  Sorry I don't have any.  
341200	  Unfortunately, I do not.

341203	  They cost $499.  
341300	  Sure! What do you think about the white chair between the rugs, the white chair just to the right of the room divider, or the white chair just to the left of the first one?  
341301	  I have that brown one in the back.  
341302	  Which one do you mean?  
341303	  The brown one has a 3.8 rating and a $499 brand, and the white one has a 2.9 rating and costs $349.  
341400	  What do you think of the grey rug in front of the red sofa?  
341401	  Certainly, I've added it to your cart.  
341402	  This one is the only one I have.  
341403	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?  
341500	  What do you think of the red rug on the far left, or perhaps the blue rug on the right?  
341501	  These two blue rugs are the only ones like that.  
341502	  I'm sorry, I couldn't find anything that matched your criteria.  
341503	  I have a white chair on the left side of the room and another in front of it.  
341600	  What do you think of the brown table? It's by StyleNow Feed.  
341601	  How about this blue couch chair and this brown one?  
341602	  I'm sorry, we don't have any leather couches by 212 Local with good customer ratings.  
341603	  How about the white one at the end of the brown rug?  
341700	  Sure, what do you think of the grey chair at the table on the left, or the white chair just past the divide?  
341701	  Sure, the one to the right is made of natural fibers, while the one in front of it is also made of natural fibers.  
341702	  Yes, both of those are leather area rugs, made by Uptown Studio and cost $449.  
341703	  I'm sorry, that's all we currently have in stock.  
341800	  I found one in the back on the right.  
341801	  The white chair by the River Chateau costs $349, and the brown one by 212 Local costs $499.  
341802	  I'll add that to your cart.  
341803	  Sure, I'll add that to your cart.  
341900	  How about this blue one?  
341901	  The two white armchairs in the back and the brown one at the front of the room are made by Downtown Stylists.  
341902	  Sorry, I don't have anything matching that description.  
341903	  Both of these have leather upholstery and are made from leather.  
342000	  Sure, there's a blue rug in back to the left.  
342001	  You've got it!  
342002	  You got it! I'll put those in your cart in just a sec.  
342003	  You might also want to take a look at this black and white chair in the back of the room, this black chair with a golden stripe pattern on the white rug in the middle, and this white chair in front of that white rug.  
342100	  I think you might be interested in the chair directly in front of you on the left in the center.  
342101	  The three chairs on this side of the ladder table meet your requirements.  
342102	  Not that I could find.  
342103	  Sure!  The brown one has good ratings and also has a good rating.  
342200	  How about this brown one on the blue rug?  
342201	  Adding to your cart now.  
342202	  Sorry, but nothing else seems to be coming up for you.  
342203	  I don't have anything that matches your criteria.  
342300	  How is this table in the back set?

381601	  I think that the white one in the front could work.

382402	  Sorry, which tables?  
382403	  Both are $399 and made by Uptown Studio.  
382500	  I'm sorry, I don't have any items to show you like that right now.  
382501	  Of course! You will see it in your cart shortly.  
382502	  In a natural wood finish, we have one on the right side of this set of shelves, and another just behind it.  
382503	  OK. I will add these two tables and chairs to your cart.  
382600	  How about this white sofa chair to the right of the mirror, or the brown one in the center of the room?  
382601	  Could you specify?  
382602	  That one is made by Modern Arts.  
382603	  How about the one on the right? It is one of those.  
382700	  Sure, there's a nice brown one on the blue rug right in front of you.  What do you think?  
382701	  Which item are you referring to?  
382702	  That chair is made by Downtown Stylists.  
382703	  These are the only items we have like that.

382801	  I've got this brown one from Modern Arts in the center.  
382802	  I'll put those in your cart.  
382803	  I'm sorry, we don't have any wooden tables.  
382900	  What do you think about the white chair or the black and white chair?  
382901	  I'm sorry, these are all we have. Can I get you something different?

383102	  I'm sorry, I don't have any rugs by North Lodge with similar ratings.  
383103	  Sorry, I can't find anything like that. Can I find something else?  
383200	  Here's these two white ones.  
383201	  These two are the only ones that fit your criteria.  
383202	  Sorry, that's all I have for Modern Arts sofa chairs with a good rating.  
383203	  There are two chairs on the right.  
383300	  I have the white chair on the rug behind the blue rug, and the white chair on the blue rug behind the brown table.  
383301	  The blue rug is from Home Store, and has a good rating.  
383302	  That rug is made of natural fibers.  
383303	  Which rug?  
383400	  How about this one on the right?  
383401	  They both have a rating of 3.4.

383601	  Not really, just the brown one.  
383602	  Certainly!  The two chairs are made out of leather, and each has a rating of 4.2.  
383603	  What about this white one on the left behind the white sofa?  
383700	  How about the red one in the back, or maybe the blue one?  
383701	  Which one?  
383702	  It costs $499.  
383703	  No, I don't have anything that matches your criteria.  
383800	  We have a wooden table in the back left on the grey rug.  
383801	  Yes, take a look at this grey one in the back right set.  
383802	  Sorry, which table?  
383803	  This table is made of metal.  
383900	  What do you think of the brown chair on the left, the brown chair right next to it or the blue chair right next to it? They are all couch chairs.  
383901	  Which item are you asking about?  
383902	  Unfortunately, I have no highly-rated chairs at this time.  
383903	  I'm glad you like them! I'll add two of those chairs to your cart now!  
384000	  How about this brown one on the right side of the display?  
384001	  Which tables are you referring to?  
384002	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything from that brand.  
384003	  Absolutely! I'll add them both to your cart.  
384100	  Do you like either of the two brown tables against the back wall?  
384101	  We have this grey one right next to it.  
384102	  There's a grey rug on the rug in the back.  
384103	  I'm sorry, but nothing like that is currently available.  
384200	  How do you like the grey one up front, or the red one in back?  
384201	  Can you clarify which one you're referring to?  
384202	  It's rated at 3.1.  
384203	  No problem, I'll add it to your cart.  
384300	  What do you think of the brown chair and the other brown chair to the right?  
384301	  Sorry, which one?  
384302	  It is $499.  
384303	  Okay, I will add the grey rug and the white end table to your cart.  
384400	  How about these two?  
384401	  Sorry, I can't find anything else.  
384402	  I have that table, and also the one next to it.  
384403	  I will do that.  
384500	  Here is a wooden table.  
384501	  Sorry, but I don't see anything like that today.  
384502	  There's one wooden table which matches your criteria.  
384503	  Okay, the sofa chairs will be added.  
384600	  Have you considered that white chair on the blue rug under the brown chair?  
384601	  Unfortunately, there are no similar leather recliners to offer at this time. Would you like my help with anything else?  
384602	  Of course. I've placed both in your cart.  
384603	  Sorry, no item matches your criteria.  
384700	  Do you like this one?  
384701	  I will add those now.  
384702	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I show you something different?  
384703	  Ok, I will add another one of that grey rug to your cart now.  
384800	  There's one chair in between the two couches that I recommend, and a small on the striped rug in the back.  
384801	  I'll add that to your cart.  
384802	  Which one?  
384803	  That is $349.  
384900	  I'm sorry, I couldn't find any low-cost couch chairs.  
384901	  Which chair are you asking about?  
384902	  Thank you! That chair has a natural wood finish.  
384903	  Unfortunately, I am unable to find anything like that. Can I help you with anything else?  
385000	  What do you think of these?  
385001	  Sorry, but no. What else can I do for you today?  
385002	  Okay, it will be added.  
385003	  Sorry, nothing else matches your criteria.  
385100	  I found these two tables for you.  
385101	  How about this one in the back?  
385102	  Which table?  
385103	  Which tables are you talking about?  
385200	  What do you think about that table right in front of the partition on the right?

385202	  Which one do you mean?  
385203	  It's from StyleNow Feed.  
385300	  How about this wooden one?  
385301	  I have these three sofa chairs on the white rug, tell me your opinion.  
385302	  I'm sorry, but there are no other sofa chairs. Is there something else I can assist you with?  
385303	  Okay, I will add that to your cart.  
385400	  Do you like this blue one on the left side of the room?  
385401	  Unfortunately, we don't have anything meeting your specifications at the moment.  
385402	  How do you like the brown chair in the back to the left of the red sofa?  
385403	  Absolutely! They're in your cart now.  
385500	  How do you like this white one?  
385501	  That table by the chair to the left has that same material, as well as that brown one in the back.  
385502	  Sorry, I don't see any tables with that description.  
385503	  Great! I'll put it in your cart for you.  
385600	  I have two accent chairs, both of them color white.  
385601	  Those two are the only ones like them.  
385602	  Which ones do you mean?  
385603	  Sorry, I can't find anything from that brand.  
385700	  Yes, I have a nice black chair in the back next to the table lamp.  
385701	  The only one that matches those criteria is that black wooden table by the green sofa.  
385702	  Sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something else?  
385703	  No, I don't have anything from that brand.  
385800	  Do you like either of these grey couch chairs by Downtown Stylists? They are both made of leather.  
385801	  I have these two wooden tables in back.  
385802	  What do you think about the wooden table in back behind the wall?  
385803	  Of course. I'll add those to your cart now.  
385900	  How about the grey rug in the middle of the room?  
385901	  I'm sorry, I don't have any sofas made out of wool by Modern Arts.  
385902	  These two couch chairs are the only ones we have like that.  
385903	  Ok, I'll do that now.  
386000	  How about the blue rug at the back, the red rug in front of it, or maybe the white one towards the front?  
386001	  No problem, I'll do that now.  
386002	  Which one?  
386003	  It costs $199.  
386100	  I have a white sofa chair to the left of the white chair, as well as a white sofa chair just to the right of the white one. Do you like them?  
386101	  Awesome! I'll put those in your cart.  
386102	  Sure, they're both made of leather and cost $499.  
386103	  Take a look at the wooden table on the left, in front of the brown couch.  
386200	  Sure, there's a table straight ahead in the back on the right.  
386201	  Sure, over at the back right corner is a white rug with a natural look.  You can see a blue area rug under the white chair.  Over on the left is a white rug with a solid color.  
386202	  Sorry, we only have the one table at the back left.  
386203	  Great, I'll add that to your cart.  
386300	  I found a grey coat on the circular rack in the back, another grey coat hanging in the shelving unit, and a grey coat on the rack near the hats.  
386301	  There's a black hat on the far right of the table, as well as a red, white, and yellow one in the middle of the leftmost cubby.  What do you think of those?  
386302	  Sorry, I don't have anything matching that description.  Could I help you with something else?  
386303	  I don't happen to have any hats matching that description, just the ones we have at the moment.  
386304	  I'll update your cart.  
386400	  Of course, how do you feel about the green one on the left side of the table or the other green one on the right side?  
386401	  Sure, in the third cabinet from the left, I have the brown jacket at the left.  
386402	  Sure, I've added it to your cart.

386503	  Sorry, I don't have anything from Global Voyager.  
386504	  Sorry, I can't find anything else. Is there anything else I can do for you?  
386600	  How about the white T-shirt on the top right?  
386601	  I'll do that.  
386602	  That's the only similar option.  
386603	  The shirt on the bottom right is medium and has a customer review of 3.8. The other shirt is large and has a customer review of 4.8.  
386604	  The only differences are the customer review score and the price of the black T-shirt.  
386700	  I have the pink one in the third cubby from the left, the pink one at the bottom of the left wall, and the pink one at the front of the right wall.  
386701	  I'll add that to your cart.  
386702	  Unfortunately, that's the only sweater available in that size.  
386703	  The first is from Coats &amp; More, the other from Global Voyager.  
386704	  Okay, I will add those items to your cart.  
386800	  I can help with that. Do you like either of the black ones on the bottom right or the green one on the bottom left? They are all sweaters.

387001	  I'm sorry, I don't have any other sweaters.  
387002	  The yellow one has a 4.6 rating and the red one has a 4.7 rating.  
387003	  I can show you that. I have the brown one hanging up in the center of the top row on the wall.

387200	  I have a couple hanging up on the table.  Moving over from the table you can see a blue jacket and a light grey one.

387202	  The gray and white one is available in XS, L, XL, and XXL and has good reviews. The blue one is available in S, M, and XXL and has good reviews.  
387203	  I don't have anything quite like that right now. Is there anything else I could show you?

387903	  Sorry I don't.  
387904	  Take a look at the green and violet blouse on the right, the green and violet blouse to the left of it, and the black blouse next to it.

436902	  I apologize, but I can't find anything that meets those requirements. Would you like my help with anything else?  
436903	  Unfortunately, I don't have anything like that. Can I help with something else?  
436904	  Unfortunately, I cannot find anything that satisfies all of your preferences. Is there anything else you need to look for?  
437000	  I think you'd be crazy about that blue and white one at the bottom right of the shelf in the middle of the room.  
437001	  I can't find any other tshirts.  
437002	  I can offer you the grey and white jacket in the leftmost cubby of the left dresser, the black jacket just below it, and the blue jacket on the rack in front of us.  
437003	  Okay, I'll add it to your cart.

437102	  The one on the back table is XXL. The other one is XS.  
437103	  I don't have anything like that.  
437104	  They are both available in XS, S, M, L, XL, and XXL.  
437200	  I would be happy to help. Take a look at this light grey jacket on the left rack, the blue jacket to its right, and the grey and white jacket in the second cubby of the right dresser.  
437201	  Sure! I have three black blouses in your cart. There's one on the wall at the bottom left and a few more to the right of that. Do either of those interest you?  
437202	  Unfortunately, I cannot find any such items.  
437203	  I am unable to confirm or locate any of those. Would you like to see something else?  
437204	  Of course! Both sweaters will be in your cart in just a moment.  
437300	  Do you like this green one?  
437301	  I can help with that. I have the dark blue pair on the right, the dark blue pair to the left of those, and the light blue pair to the left of those.

437503	  I have a grey one on the top left, second from the left, and a black one to the right of that.

437600	  How do you like these jackets?  
437601	  Do you like the black and white ones on the bottom of the right wall?

437604	  Ok. I will do that now.  
437700	  Sure! How do you like the light blue jeans in the very back left cubby?  
437701	  Both pairs are available in S, XL, and XXL.  
437702	  Sorry, but I have nothing that matches your search parameters.  
437703	  Great, I'll put them in your cart for you.  
437704	  Yes, all three pairs of jeans on the left are good matches.  
437800	  Do you like the grey coat hanging on the top right?  
437801	  What do you think of the grey jeans in the back?

438003	  You got it! Adding them now.  
438004	  Certainly, the jacket in the back has been added to your cart.  
438100	  The black one on the front rack has a good rating, but you don't really want to pay more than that.  
438101	  The red and white is an XL, and the grey is an XS.  
438102	  The red and white jacket is an XL and the grey jacket is a L.

438200	  How about the white and grey one hanging up on the right wall?  
438201	  Unfortunately, I don't currently have anything like that.  
438202	  That is the only tee you've got, sorry.  
438203	  I'm sorry, which item did you want to know about?  
438204	  It comes in XS, M, L, XL, and XXL.  
438300	  There is a white and grey shirt on the table which matches your criteria.  
438301	  Take a look at the blue shirt on the back of the table and the grey shirt at the top left of the table.  
438302	  Sorry, there are no items which match your search criteria.  
438303	  Sorry, but nothing matches your criteria.  
438304	  Which coat?  
438400	  I can help you find that. I have this red and white one on the left.  
438401	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything else right now. Can I get you something different?  
438402	  Which one?  
438403	  This one is priced at 109.99 and is available in XS, S, and M.  
438404	  Both shirts are long sleeved.  
438500	  That long-sleeved grey one you saw would be a great choice for work, as would the bright blue option right next to it.  
438501	  Not at all! Would you mind being a bit more precise on which item you are interested in?  
438502	  I think that long-sleeve red and white jacket from earlier might be the one you are looking for.  
438503	  The blue one is less expensive at $109.99, while the grey and white one costs $44.99.

439000	  I have three black dresses on the wall display. One is on the left, another on the right, and the last is hanging on the top row.  
439001	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?  
439002	  There's a black sweater on the left floor rack that might interest you, a pink sweater just above the pink sweater, and a red and white sweater hanging on the wall at the back.  
439003	  Okay, I'll add that beige dress to your cart.

439200	  What do you think of the grey one in the back to the left or the black one to the left of it?  
439201	  Nothing, unfortunately. Is there something else I could help you find?  
439202	  Which one do you mean?  
439203	  It's from 212 Local.  
439204	  Okay, it will be added.  
439300	  Do you like this grey and white jacket on the rack to the left?

439400	  I can show you expensive pants. I have the gray ones in the second cubby from the right.

439800	  There are several pair of jeans on the far left which you might like.  
439801	  I'm sorry, we don't. Can I help you find anything else?  
439802	  Sorry, but I couldn't find anything like that. What else can I do for you?  
439803	  You got it. Adding now.  
439804	  Sure thing. I will add it now.  
439900	  Do you like the two pairs in the back right cubbies? They are both expensive jeans with good customer reviews.

441202	  Unfortunately, those are the only blue sofas I have.

441400	  How is this brown table at the back?  
441401	  For which one?  
441402	  That coffee table is rated 3.1.  
441403	  I don't have any chairs like that at the moment.  
441500	  The rectangular table behind the partition wall might suit your needs.  
441501	  Sure, the two chairs you have already seen fit your needs.  
441502	  Unfortunately, I don't have anything like that. Would you like to shop for anything else?  
441503	  The black table is a new price, at $549, and it is made of wood. The white table is also $549, and it is made of wood. Both tables cost $399, but the black table is the winner.  
441600	  I have two wooden coffee tables by the sofas.  What do you think?  
441601	  Okay, I will add them to your cart.  
441602	  Similar items include the two chairs you added to your cart.

441902	  How about the white one behind the middle table, or the grey one next to the brown table you just bought?  
441903	  Unfortunately, we don't have anything like that.  
442000	  I can offer you three sofa chairs. The first is the white sofa chair, then the brown chair next to it.  
442001	  I'm sorry, we don't have any affordable couches in stock today.  
442002	  You've got it! I'll update your cart with the sofa now.  
442003	  Sure thing! I am now adding this end table to your cart.

442201	  How about that grey sofa?  
442202	  Which one are you talking about?  
442203	  It has a 4.5 rating.  
442300	  I don't have anything like that either.  
442301	  Nothing to show for those criteria.  
442302	  I have a white and gray one to the left of that red couch, and a red one in the middle.  
442303	  I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?  
442400	  Both of these are brown metal coffee tables.  
442401	  Both are metal! The one in the back is rated 3.2, and the one in front has a customer rating of 4.9.  
442402	  The chair right next to that brown table would be the perfect match for you!  
442403	  Oh my gosh thank you! I will take care of your cart right away!  
442500	  Sure, how do you like the coffee table on the gray rug in the middle of the room?  
442501	  Sorry, I don't currently have any items like that.

442700	  How about the white chair next to the table, or the brown chair in front of that one?  
442701	  I'm sorry, could you be more specific which item you're referring to?  
442702	  That one is $449.  
442703	  Of course, I'll put that in your cart.  
442800	  What do you think of the one in the back?

462804	  Which item are you referring to?  
462900	  No problem! What do you think of the green hoodie above the camo pants or the blue hoodie on the wall, to your left?  
462901	  Perhaps you'd like the brown hoodie in the middle of the second unit from the left, the brown hoodie on the right beside the camo pants, or the other brown one on the floor rack at the far back right?  
462902	  No, I don't happen to have any shirts by that brand.  
462903	  Of course! Take a look at these. I have a dark brown dress on the bottom rack, a black dress on the same rack, and a brown dress to its right. What do you think of those?

531500	  How about the brown chair to the left of the red couch or the brown chair next to the red couch?

531600	  There is a white option in the center which might interest you.  
531601	  You might consider these two white ones in front of us.  
531602	  Great. I'll add them to your cart now.  
531603	  Could you tell me which one?  
531700	  Sure, over at the back right you can see a white armchair, with two white rugs just beyond it.  
531701	  I'm sorry, could you be more specific which chair you're referring to?  
531702	  What do you think of the two white chairs just to the right of that armchair on the right?  
531703	  Okay. I've added the white armchair to your cart.  
531800	  I have this white one and a brown one, both on the right.  
531801	  Absolutely, I've added both chairs to your cart.  
531802	  Those three I just showed you may be perfect!  
531803	  Confirmed. Adding those as well.  
531900	  How about the white chair on the right?  
531901	  Sorry, that's the only table like that available.  
531902	  Aside from that white one, I can offer you the long white bench chair to the right of that one.  
531903	  Sorry, which chairs exactly?  
532000	  Sorry, I can't find any expensive chairs with a rating of 2.9.  
532001	  They are both metal.  
532002	  I have one brown chair that matches your preferences.  
532003	  I found these three chairs. They both have a good rating.  
532100	  I have these three white options.  
532101	  The one on the left is by North Lodge.  
532102	  Which ones?  
532103	  Sorry, I only have those three.  
532200	  How about the white one in the back right corner?  
532201	  They're both made from leather, and both cost $399.  
532202	  Both would go well. Do you care for either?  
532203	  Sorry, I don't have anything else that matches your criteria.  
532300	  Take a look at this one on the left, the other white one to the right, or the one further away from us in front of the table.  
532301	  Both of those lamps cost $549.  
532302	  How do you like the white chair against the wall, or the other white one between the two rugs?  
532303	  Absolutely, I'll add it to your cart.  
532400	  In the far back on the right, I have that accent chair with a good rating.  
532401	  That white chair in the back fits your color scheme.  
532402	  I will be happy to add that to your cart.  
532403	  Ok, I'll add that to your cart.  
532500	  I'm sorry, I don't have any affordable accent chairs.  
532501	  Both have a rating of 3.2.  
532502	  Both of those items are so similar that I think you may like them.  
532503	  I'm sorry, I couldn't find anything by that description.  
532600	  What do you think of this white one up front by the red sofa or the white one behind that in front?  
532601	  I've got the short one to the left of the gray couch, and the long one to the right of the blue couch.  
532602	  Sure, the short white one costs $649 and the long one costs $349.  
532603	  The one in the back is $549, the one in the front is $249.  
532700	  I can suggest the couch chair in the middle and to the left of the lamp.  
532701	  Which one?  
532702	  That rug has a customer rating of 3.4.  
532703	  Which one?  
532800	  There are two white couch chairs you might like. What do you think?  
532801	  Sorry, those are the only options I found.  
532802	  Both are made by Downtown Consignment.  
532803	  Okay, it will be added.  
532900	  Take a look at the brown chair in the center and let me know what you think.  
532901	  Sorry, which chair?  
532902	  It's leather.  
532903	  That's the only chair available.  
533000	  How about this brown one on the right side of the divider?  
533001	  Sure thing.  
533002	  Sorry, I can't find anything else that matches your description.  
533003	  Check out the white one on the left and the one on the right, both of them.  
533100	  I don't think I do.  Could I help you find something else?  
533101	  Sure, the white table costs $399 and the black table costs $649.  
533102	  I do, I have the first white armchair in the middle and another white armchair in the center.  Do you like either of those?  
533103	  Certainly, I've added the armchair to your cart.  
533200	  How about the brown armchair up front and the blue one in the back?  
533201	  Sorry, I don't have any Modern Arts sofa chairs.  
533202	  They are both made of metal.  
533203	  That's all we have right now.  
533300	  What do you think of the white couch chair in the very back right corner and the other white couch chair in the front left corner?  
533301	  Sorry, no, no couch chairs have a good rating and by Downtown Consignment.  
533302	  Sorry, I couldn't find anything. Wanna look again?  
533303	  Sure thing.  
533400	  The white chair on the left would fit the bill.  
533401	  There are several sofa chairs I recommend, all in white. The sofa chair on the rug further away from us, and the grey one next to it.  
533402	  Sorry, which two chairs?  
533403	  Both of these chairs have a rating of 4.2.  
533500	  How about the three brown arm chairs in the middle display case?  
533501	  The two arm chairs are the only ones.  
533502	  The one to the left is leather from Downtown Stylists, the other is made of wool from 212 Local.  
533503	  Only that white one I showed you.  
533600	  Sure, here are a few we have.  There's a white ottoman in front of the blue rug, and a white chair just beyond that.  
533601	  Both are made of leather. The chair to the left is rated 2.9, and the other is rated 3.3.  
533602	  Which sofa chairs do you mean?  
533603	  Perfect, I will add that sofa chair to your cart.  
533700	  What do you think of the white chair?  
533701	  Sorry, nothing matches that description.  
533702	  Which white chair are you talking about?  
533703	  It's from Modern Arts.  
533800	  I have the white chair on the left, and the other white chair next to it.  
533801	  I'm sorry, I'm not sure which items you're referring to. Could you please explain?  
533802	  Alright, I'll add that to your cart.  
533803	  Which one do you mean?  
533900	  How about the white sofa chair just to the left of the partition wall on the right?  
533901	  Sorry, could you give me some more details?  
533902	  They're both leather. The one on the left is $399 and the one on the right is $549.  
533903	  That is the only sofa chair we have.  
534000	  How do you like the white chair at the back right?  
534001	  How do you like these white ones?  
534002	  Sorry I don't see any white chairs.  
534003	  Sure thing.  
534100	  Sure, there's a white ottoman on the left on the green rug over there.  
534101	  Sure, I've updated your cart.  
534102	  I don't happen to have any chairs from that brand and a similar rating, unfortunately.  Would you like to know more about anything else?  
534103	  Which chairs do you mean?  
534200	  I do, what do you think of the two white chairs on either side of the round table in the back right?  
534201	  Great!  I'll add both of those chairs to your cart now.  
534202	  Sure, how do you feel about these?  
534203	  Great, both of those items are in your cart now.  
534300	  How about these two white ones in front?  
534301	  The white chair is the only one that matches your criteria.  
534302	  The white lamp is made by River Chateau and has a 3.9 rating, and the grey lamp is made by River Chateau and has a 2.9 rating.  
534303	  No, I couldn't find any other lamps.  
534400	  How about these? I have a blue couch chair on the right of the blue rug, another blue couch chair at the far end of the white rug, and a brown couch chair on the right side of the white rug.  
534401	  The one on the left has a 3.2 rating and the one on the right has a 3.9.  
534402	  Sorry, I don't have anything else in white right now. Can I help with something else?  
534403	  Okay, I'll add it to your cart.  
534500	  I have the two on either side of the partition to show you what you think.  
534501	  They're both from Modern Arts and have a 4.9 rating.  
534502	  I don't have anything like that.  
534503	  Of course.  I'll add those to your cart now.  
534600	  Do you like the white one in the back?  
534601	  Sorry, but I don't have any leather white chaises with good ratings.  
534602	  The small one you saw is the only one I have like that.  
534603	  Ok, great! I'll add the white rug to your cart for you.  
534700	  Do you like this blue one in the back or the white one next to it? They are both couch chairs.  
534701	  I don't see anything like that today.  
534702	  No, I don't have anything in white with those attributes.  
534703	  You've got it! I'll put them in your cart for you.  
534800	  Sure, take a look at this white one.  
534801	  Sure thing, I've updated your cart with one white armchair and one white sofa chair.  
534802	  Sorry, I don't have anything else in white.  Could I assist you with something else?  
534803	  Of course, it's made from leather and retails for $449.  
534900	  There's this brown one and this white one, both by Modern Arts.  
534901	  Sorry, that is the only thing we have.  
534902	  Ok, I'll put those in your cart.  
534903	  The one between the sofas is made of metal and costs $549. The one to the left of that is also made of metal and costs $549.  
535000	  I have one option in the back of the room that might be perfect for you. Do you like it?  
535001	  The one in the back is a leather chair from Modern Arts, and the one on the left is a white chair from Downtown Stylists.  
535002	  Sorry, I couldn't find anything matching that description.  
535003	  The white chair is 29.99.

535101	  Which items are you referring to?  
535102	  Sure! The one in the back costs $499, and the one in the back is $449.  
535103	  I don't have any other leather chairs.  
535200	  Here's a blue one that's a match.  
535201	  Unfortunately, there are no expensive CouchChair couch chairs available.  
535202	  Which item would you like to know about?  
535203	  Both are rated 3.4 and cost $649.  
535300	  I don't have anything with those requirements, I'm sorry.  
535301	  How do you like these two?  
535302	  These are all we have. What else can I help you with?  
535303	  I found these two white leather sofa chairs as well. They both have good customer ratings.  
535400	  I have two white options for you in the back and a grey one in front. Do you like any of them?  
535401	  Which ottomans?  
535402	  Which one?  
535403	  That sofa costs $449.  
535500	  I can recommend the two in the center. What do you think?  
535501	  Sorry, which armchairs are you referring to?  
535502	  Unfortunately, I have no similar leather sofas from that brand in stock.  
535503	  I'm sorry, we don't have any other leather chairs from Downtown Consignment.

535701	  The one in the back is from StyleNow Feed and the one in the front is from Downtown Stylists.  
535702	  Those three are the only options I have available.  
535703	  I'm sorry, I don't have any other pieces by Downtown Consignment in leather.  
535800	  We have these two on the left side.  
535801	  I can't find anything matching that. Is there anything else you want to see?  
535802	  The back one is $499 and has a 4.4 rating, and the right one is $399 and has a 4.0 rating.  
535803	  I'll add those both to your cart.  
535900	  What do you think of the brown couch chair on the left?  
535901	  These are the only two I found that match your criteria.

536400	  Do you like the blue one or either of the white ones?  
536401	  Sorry, none of those are from Downtown Consignment and are affordable.  
536402	  We have these three white ones.

537503	  Sure, both have been added to your cart.  
537600	  How about the one behind the sofa?

537603	  The backless one is $499, and the left one is $349.

545202	  The gray one at the back left by the shelves looks pretty nice.  
545203	  Okay, I'll add the wooden end table and the white end table to your cart.  
545300	  There's this blue area rug.  
545301	  Sure, you might like the brown sofa chair here in front of us.  
545302	  Okay, I will add this to your cart.  
545303	  I can recommend two similar end tables: the brown table on the right and the red one in the back.  
545400	  What do you think of the white chair on the left?  
545401	  Of course! That chair will be in your cart momentarily.  
545402	  Do you like the one on the right? It is a brown sofa chair.  
545403	  I'm sorry, we do not have anything else. Would you like to see something else?

545602	  Could you explain for me what you mean?  
545603	  Alright, I'll add it to your cart for you.  
545700	  I have two gray rugs available.  
545701	  Which rug are you referring to?  
545702	  That rug is made by Modern Arts.  
545703	  Take a look at the grey rug at the back? It is wool.  
545800	  There is one on the white rug to the right. What do you think?  
545801	  It's a leather chair.  
545802	  It's made of wood.  
545803	  The red one and the grey one you looked at earlier might work.  
545900	  Unfortunately, none of the sofa chairs that we have are low in price.  
545901	  Unfortunately, there are no rugs in that price range with a good customer rating, and our current inventory includes no affordable area rugs.  
545902	  No problem! How do you feel about the rug on the right?  
545903	  What item do you mean?  
546000	  There is a wooden table on the right that you might like. What do you think?  
546001	  What do you think of the white chair just to the right of the brown table?  
546002	  Sorry, nothing else matches your criteria. What else can I help you find?  
546003	  Sorry, no. Anything else you want to search for?  
546100	  There's a white chair over on the white rug at the back, and another white chair just past the lamp.  
546101	  Which tables are you referring to?  
546102	  Which chair are you talking about?  
546103	  It's made by StyleNow Feed from wood and sells for $499.  
546200	  How about this one in the back, or the one next to it?  
546201	  That table looks like it.  
546202	  Great! I'll add it to your cart.  
546203	  That's all I have for tables at the moment.  
546300	  I have three chairs for you: a white bench on the left side of the room, another white bench with a high price, and a shorter bench across from that one.  
546301	  Ok. I will add that chair now.  
546302	  This couch chair in the back is what I have to show you.  
546303	  Ok. I will add both of those now.  
546400	  How about the wooden one in the front?  
546401	  I'll gladly add it to your cart for you!

546603	  I will do so right now.  
546700	  What do you think of the one on the right?  
546701	  I have another white one in the back as well.  
546702	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that right now. Can I help with something else?

547100	  Of course!  Here's a white one at the edge of the green rug in front of you.  
547101	  I think you may like the brown chair in front of the partition in the middle of the room.  
547102	  Sorry, which one?

547200	  I have three blue area rugs, first on the left, and then on the right.

551204	  Certainly, I'll add it.  
551300	  How do you like these options?  
551301	  How is this brown shirt vest on the back wall display? There's a purple shirt vest in the front right corner.  
551302	  Sorry, I don't have any other shirt vest with vertical stripes.  
551303	  The black and orange one is a L, whereas the black one is an XS.

551404	  I have the brown one hanging in the front left and the brown one on the rack in front of the table.  
551500	  I have a couple. The brown one on the right is hanging up high at the back of the room. The brown one is below it on the wall, and the blue one is on the rack further down the room.

551603	  That hoodie is rated at 3.0.  
551604	  How do you feel about this one?  
551700	  Take a look at the brown hoodie in the rightmost cabinet, and the blue hoodie on the front rack.  
551701	  Do you like the brown jacket on the left?  
551702	  There are some more jackets that match your criteria.  
551703	  Sorry, but nothing matches your search criteria. What else can I do for you?  
551704	  Which one?  
551800	  How about the blue ones hanging in the very back on the table to the left? Or maybe the black one to the left of them?  
551801	  Sorry, I don't have anything like that.  
551802	  Tell me if you like the black jacket on the rack and the black jacket on the top row in the left wall, both of which are by HairDo.  
551803	  Could you please specify which jacket?  
551804	  That jacket is made by North Lodge.

552200	  Take a look at the blue jacket hanging second from the left in the top row on the left wall in the back, the black jacket next to it, and the grey jacket  on the far right next to the black one.  
552201	  Okay, that item will be added to your cart.

552203	  The green ones are extra small and costs $244.99. The brown ones are extra extra large and costs $244.99.  
552204	  Okay, I will add them to your cart.  
552300	  There's a green and white tank top to the left of that dress on the left.  
552301	  There are several. What do you think of the grey jeans on the bottom, the light blue jeans in the middle, and the blue jeans on the right?  
552302	  Sorry, which one?  
552303	  They are both L.

552402	  This jacket is priced at 174.99 and comes in sizes XS, S, L, and XXL.  
552403	  I have the violet one hanging on the bottom row to the right.  
552404	  This red, white, and yellow blouse on the left wall, top row, is what I have to show you.  
552500	  I can help with that. Do you like the brown one on the left?  
552501	  I don't have anything like that. Can I show you something different?  
552502	  The blue, black pair is $139.99 and the light blue pair is $164.99.  
552503	  Take a look at the light blue pair in the back to the left or the blue pair in the front.  
552504	  Which ones do you mean?  
552600	  I found three hoodies for you to view. First, see if you like the green one hanging up on the center row in front. Then, see if you like the brown one next to it. Finally, take a look at the green hoodie hanging on the center rack in front of you.  
552601	  Sorry I can't find anything that matches those criteria.  
552602	  What do you think of the white and black blouse, the violet, and black blouse, and the grey and white blouse?  
552603	  Both of these blouses are a L, and are rated 2.8.  
552604	  I don't have any blouses matching that description in XL.  
552700	  I found three for you. There's a black one in the very center on the bottom shelf, a grey one in the middle of the bottom shelf, and a red one just above it.  
552701	  Sorry, I'm not sure which item you're asking about. Could you give me some more detail?  
552702	  That dress costs $149.99.  
552703	  What do you think about the golden ones on the top or the grey ones next to them?  
552704	  I don't happen to have any other leafy-pattern shoes.  
552800	  I've got the gray one hanging at the far left of the back wall, the blue one second from the right on the bottom tier of the table, and the black one at the bottom left of the back wall.  
552801	  Could you specify which two?  
552802	  The light gray one has a 3.4, the light gray one has a 4.2.  
552803	  Certainly.  Adding those right away.

552900	  What do you think of the black coat on the front left rack, the brown coat on the right rack, and the other brown coat on the right rack?  
552901	  The black one is by Pedals & Gears and the grey one is by 212 Local.  
552902	  Which one are you referring to?  
552903	  The customer rating is 4.1.  
552904	  How about this red and white one?  
553000	  The wooden one behind the desk has a very high rating, at 4.5.  
553001	  I'm so sorry, but we do not have any expensive Modern Arts hats in stock at this time. Is there something else I might be able to assist with?  
553002	  If you're looking for a jacket, the red and white jacket next to the striped shirt in the back of the shop, the black jacket to the left of the maroon jacket and the blue jacket to the right of the red and white one are all highly rated.  
553003	  I'm sorry, I'm having some trouble figuring out which items you're looking at. Could you please clarify?  
553004	  Thank you! The blue one is a size XL, and it comes in XS, M, L, XL and XXL. The grey one is a size XXL, and it comes in S and XL.  
553100	  I can show you cheap blouses. Do you like the black and white one hanging up on the top right of the wall, the black and white one hanging below it, or the green, violet, and pink one hanging up on the top left?  
553101	  I have this grey and white one up in the cubby on the back right, the blue one on the back center rack, and the black one hanging in the cubby on the front right.  
553102	  Which one?  
553103	  This one is available in small.  
553104	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that.  
553200	  I have one on the right wall, beside the grey and white jacket. What do you think?  
553201	  I'm sorry, I don't see anything like that today. Can I get you something else?  
553202	  Which blouses are you referring to?  
553203	  The black, white one has a 2.6, and the black, white one has a 3.6.  
553204	  There are a couple of other sweaters on the table you might like. The red and white one to the left of the black, white one, and the brown one in the middle of the table.

553602	  Which ones?  
553603	  Both sofas are priced at $599.  
553700	  I think you may be a fan of the grey sofa in the back right set!  
553701	  Could you clarify which you're referring to?  
553702	  Unfortunately, I don't have any chairs made of natural fibers. Is there anything else I can find for you?  
553703	  You've got it! I'll get that in your cart right away.  
553800	  Take a look at the blue chair on the left.  
553801	  That pair is by Downtown Stylists, but it is rated quite highly.  
553802	  Great, I've added it to your cart.  
553803	  Ok, great, I will add those two white accent chairs to your cart.  
553900	  How about the grey coffee table on the grey rug to the right?  
553901	  I have two brown chairs, both from Modern Arts. What do you think?  
553902	  Sorry, I don't have anything like that.  
553903	  Sure thing! I will add the sofa to your cart.  
554000	  Here's these two gray ones.

554301	  No problem, I'll add it to your cart for you.  
554302	  Unfortunately, I have no other options to recommend.  
554303	  The only two grey rugs in stock are the one we looked at earlier. The blue rug on the left and this grey rug right next to it.  
554400	  Sure, there's a brown one at the back right that you can see, and a grey one at the back left.  
554401	  Which ones are you talking about?  
554402	  The brown coffee table in the very back is by Art Den and costs $399, and the other one is by Uptown Studio and costs $399.  
554403	  I don't currently, unfortunately.  
554500	  Here is a wooden table I found for you.  
554501	  The wooden table in the back of the room on the right is made of wood.  
554502	  Certainly. What do you think about the one to the left or the one to the right of that one?  
554503	  Ok, I will add this sofa chair to your cart now.

554900	  Sure, what do you think of the grey sofa at the edge of the red rug?  
554901	  Sure, they both have a rating of 3.7.  
554902	  Yes, the coffee table directly in front of you might be a good choice.  
554903	  Got it. Adding it now.  
555000	  How about the black chair in the center?

555300	  How about the gray rug on the right?

555303	  The one on the left is all we have like that.  
555400	  I have two brown coffee tables in the back corner. What do you think?  
555401	  I couldn't find any tables that match your preferences.  
555402	  There is also the grey rug in front of us. What do you think?  
555403	  Of course. I am adding that sofa chair to your cart.  
555500	  I'm sorry, we don't have anything quite like that.  
555501	  Sorry, I can't find anything matching that description. Can I get you anything else?  
555502	  The two coffee tables on either side of the grey sofa I showed you are what I have to show you right now.  
555503	  Sorry, I don't have anything else to show you.  
555600	  I have the brown table in the very back on the red rug, the other brown table to the left, and the white one directly in front of us on the green rug.  
555601	  Sorry, nothing else fits your description.  
555602	  What do you think about that wooden table and the brown one behind it?  
555603	  I don't have anything quite like that right now.  
555700	  Ok, the white sofa chair just past the long table would fit the bill.  
555701	  Sorry, I don't see anything like that right now.  Could I help you look for something else?  
555702	  Sure, there's a brown ottoman just beside the blue chair.

556101	  The white couch chair is made of leather, and the blue couch chair is leather.  
556102	  I have nothing else like that.

556200	  What do you think of the two brown ones in the center or the blue one in the middle?  
556201	  Sorry, I can't find anything like that.  
556202	  Alright, adding those right away!

556300	  What do you think of the table in the back right?  
556301	  Unfortunately, I couldn't find any Modern Arts tables.  
556302	  They both have a rating of 3.1 and are made by Modern Arts.  
556303	  Unfortunately I don't see any other couch chairs with that price and rating.  
556400	  We have this one in the center of the floor, add that to your cart, as well as the other chair in the center of the room.  
556401	  Which ones?  
556402	  Both of them are wood end tables.  
556403	  Both are made of leather.  
556500	  How about this wooden table in the back?  
556501	  Sorry, I don't have any other tables by Modern Arts.  
556502	  Which end table are you referring to?  
556503	  It's $399.  
556600	  Sure, there's a couple grey options along the back wall.  
556601	  Ok, what do you think of the blue chair up front by the window or the white one a little further back?  
556602	  Those are both $349 white chairs made by Downtown Stylists.  
556603	  Alright, I'll add that chair and the white end table for you.  
556700	  Yes, how about this one?  
556701	  The one to the left of the first brown couch is $399 and rated 3.2, while the one closer to the front is $399 and rated 3.4.  
556702	  Both are metal, but the brown one has a 2.9 and the black one has a 3.9.  
556703	  Sorry, nothing matches your search criteria.  
556800	  How do you like this brown coffee table?  
556801	  The coffee table on the left has a rating of 3.5, whereas the one on the right has a rating of 3.1.  
556802	  The white chair next to the gray couch on the blue rug might be of interest.  
556803	  Okay, I will add it to your cart.  
556900	  What do you think about the grey coffee table or the brown coffee table?  
556901	  Sorry, I can't find anything.  
556902	  Which one?  
556903	  It's rated 4.2 and made by Downtown Stylists.  
557000	  I found one for you on the grey rug to the left.  
557001	  I will put it in your cart for you.  
557002	  Sorry I can't find anything else. Is there anything else I can find for you?  
557003	  Which item are you referring to?  
557100	  Sure, how about the grey sofa facing away from us?  
557101	  Of course, I'll add those now.

557200	  I have these two white ones in the front and a grey one in the back.  
557201	  What do you think of the two grey coffee tables on the left and right side of the room?  
557202	  Sorry, those are the only options.  
557203	  Both are $449 and each retails for $499.  
557300	  What do you think of the brown chair at the back right, the white chair next to the lamp, or the white chair to the right of that one?  
557301	  I don't have any expensive wool sofa chairs at an affordable price.  
557302	  Oh, what's the color in the grey couch chair? Or the brown one? They both have a good customer rating.  
557303	  Unfortunately, we have no such items. Can I help with anything else?  
557400	  Take a look at the wooden table on the right.  
557401	  Sure thing, both are now in your cart.  
557402	  That sofa is made of leather, and it boasts a customer rating of 3.1.  
557403	  Yes. I will add two more of those.  
557500	  How about this grey one to the left of the brown sofa?  
557501	  Sorry, I couldn't find anything that matches your criteria.  
557502	  Could you clarify which one you mean?  
557503	  It retails for $449.  
557600	  What do you think of the white sofa chair and the other white sofa chair to the left?  
557601	  Which ones?  
557602	  The blue one is from Modern Arts and has a 3.2 rating. The white one is made by Downtown Consignment and has a 4.4 rating.  
557603	  How about the two brown coffee tables to the right of the white one on the left?  
557700	  We have that classic grey table in the very back left.  
557701	  Sorry, for which item?  
557702	  Sorry, I can't find anything like that. What else can I do for you?  
557703	  Unfortunately, there are no similar items to that information.  
557800	  I have a table at the back to the right by the green couch.  It's wooden.  
557801	  Sorry, but there are no expensive area rugs.  
557802	  Sorry, I couldn't find anything that matches that description.  
557803	  Which one do you mean?  
557900	  There is a brown chair and a blue chair that you might like.  
557901	  No, there isn't.  
557902	  Sure thing.  
557903	  Okay, I'll add that chair to your cart as well.  
558000	  Sorry, I can't find any that are cheap and metal.  
558001	  Those white lamps are the only two that are similar.  
558002	  You got it. I'll put that table in your cart right away.  
558003	  You bet! I'll add two white end tables to your cart now.  
558100	  Do you like either the brown one on the left or the white one in front?  
558101	  How about the one at the front left of the room, or the one to the left of it?  
558102	  Both tables are rated 3.7.  
558103	  Sure thing, I'll put it in your cart.  
558200	  What do you think of the brown one next to the green sofa in the back?  
558201	  The closer option is rated 3.4 and costs $399. The closer option has a slightly higher rating at 4.9, and the area rug further back costs $549.  
558202	  The grey sofa is priced at $499. It has an impressive rating of 2.9 and is made by Modern Arts.  
558203	  No biggie, they're both priced at $349.  
558300	  Tell me how you feel about the wooden table, by the wooden table?  
558301	  Excellent! I'll add it to your cart.  
558302	  The blue one is made of leather, while the white one is leather.  
558303	  I don't see any other white ottomans right now.  
558400	  Do you like the white one on the left? It is a North Lodge area rug.  
558401	  Not that I could find.  
558402	  I don't see anything like that.  
558403	  Sure! Both of these rugs have a rating of 3.6.  
558500	  What do you think of the two in the back on the left?  
558501	  Which items are you referring to?  
558502	  Which item are you referring to?  
558503	  That table costs $399.  
558600	  How about that brown sofa to the left of the green couch, or the one in the far back?  
558601	  I sure can! Will do!  
558602	  You bet! That brown metal coffee table at the edge of the brown rug in the back might interest you!  
558603	  The white lamps are slightly more expensive, at $549 each. The other lamp in the foreground costs $649, while the white one on the left is also more expensive, at $549.  
558700	  Take a look at that gray one.  
558701	  I have one white one in front of the rug, and another on the left.  
558702	  The sofa chair to the left between the two white arm chairs and the chair on the right arm are both nice!  
558703	  Great. I'll add the two white armchairs to your cart.  
558800	  There are two grey sofas you might like, one on the left side of the room and one on the right side.  
558801	  They are both made by 212 Local and made of leather.  
558802	  I also have the grey sofa at the front right of the gray rug, the brown one in the very front, and the grey one in the back.  
558803	  I'm sorry, those are the only ones currently available.  
558900	  Sure, there's a brown one over at the far end of the back wall.  
558901	  Sorry, but I could find no results in the search.  
558902	  Absolutely, I will do so now.  
558903	  Sorry, could you tell me what the end table in the back is made of?  
559000	  How about this blue one, or the white one on the right?  
559001	  Which ones?  
559002	  Here's one.  
559003	  I'm sorry, I don't have any other accent chairs for you.  
559100	  I'm sorry, we don't have any affordably priced sofas in the cheap price range.  
559101	  Sure, just beyond that long grey one up front there's a brown coffee table that should work.  Anything else you'd like to look at?  
559102	  They're both metal.  
559103	  The grey sofa in the front left corner might be of interest.  
559200	  What do you think of the white one by the sofas? It is by Modern Arts.  
559201	  Certainly, how do you like the white one on the right?  
559202	  Sure, the more similar end table is the smaller table to the right of it that matches your search.  
559203	  Certainly! I'll update your cart now.  
559300	  Sorry, nothing matches your criteria.  
559301	  What do you think of the blue rug on the far right?  
559302	  Sorry, no other area rugs are available right now.  
559303	  Okay, I'll add that rug to your cart.  
559400	  What do you think of the brown chair next to the table.  
559401	  Which end table are you referring to?  
559402	  This one is rated 2.9 and costs $399.  
559403	  Ok, I'll add that end table to your cart.  
559500	  Yes, what do you think of that wooden table on the right?  
559501	  I'm afraid that is the only table that matches your current criteria.  
559502	  That one is from Modern Arts.  
559503	  Very well! I will add that to your cart now.  
559600	  What about the table over at the back right, behind the partition wall?  
559601	  The table at the back of the room on the left may be what you're looking for.  
559602	  Sorry, which rug are you interested in?  
559603	  It costs $599 and comes from Modern Arts.  
559700	  What do you think of the black and white chair up front on the right or the black and white chair on the left?  
559701	  Sorry I can't find anything that matches that description.  
559702	  Which one are you referring to?  
559703	  Thank you! The table costs $399.  
559800	  Here's a brown one you might like.  
559801	  The red one in the back has good ratings, as does the blue one in the middle of the blue rug.  
559802	  Sure. Adding them now.  
559803	  No problem. I'll add it to your cart as well.  
559900	  How about this white rug in the middle of the showroom?  
559901	  Sorry I don't have anything like that.  
559902	  Great, I'll add that to your cart.  
559903	  The one in the front has a price of $399, the one behind it is $649.  
560000	  How about the table in back or the one just to the left of it?  
560001	  I couldn't find anything. Can I help with anything else?  
560002	  Which table?  
560003	  That table costs $399.  
560100	  Do you like the white rug on the left or either of the red ones on the right? They are all rugs.  
560101	  I have the blue rug on the right and the blue one on the left as well.  
560102	  Of course! Both are made out of wood. The grey one is rated 3.2, and the blue one is rated 4.9.  
560103	  Ok. I will add that lamp now.  
560200	  Sure, how about the tall wooden table up front to the left of the partition, next to the partition?  
560201	  You got it! I'll add that table to your cart right away.  
560202	  I'm sorry, I can't find any low-priced options made of wool that are also affordable and made of wool.  
560203	  Unfortunately, we don't have anything of the sort today.  
560300	  You might be interested in the grey one on the left, the brown one in the middle, or the red sofa just beyond that one.  
560301	  I would look at the brown chair in the back left and the white chair in the front.  
560302	  Okay, both will be added to your cart.  
560303	  Okay, they will be added.  
560400	  I have three white armchairs, all of them in the center of the display. What do you think?  
560401	  That's exactly what we are referring to. Do you like the white option in the middle of the white rug?  
560402	  Great! I'll add that to your cart.  
560403	  Sure thing, two leather chairs have been added.  
560500	  Sure, what do you think of the brown chair next to the wall on the left?  
560501	  Sure, I'll add both to your cart.  
560502	  Sure, the white end table is made of wood, and costs $399.  The wooden end table is also made of wood, but more expensive at $399.  
560503	  Sorry, that's it for end tables.  
560600	  I'm sorry, I don't have any affordably priced tables in brown.  
560601	  That end table is made of wool.  
560602	  Unfortunately, I don't have anything like that.  Would you like to look for anything else?  
560603	  That I don't seem to have anything else.  
560700	  How about this grey one in the back?  
560701	  Could you please clarify which coffee table you are referring to?  
560702	  That is made by Art Den.  
560703	  That is the only one that matches that description.  
560800	  What do you think of the brown chair in the back?  
560801	  Ok, I'll put that rug in your cart.  
560802	  This one is what I have like that.  
560803	  Ok. I will add those both to your cart now.  
560900	  Sure! What do you think about the grey rug in the back?  
560901	  Of course, which rug are you referring to?  
560902	  Sure, it's rated a 3.8.  
560903	  I'm sorry, I don't have any other jackets.  
561000	  Take a look at the sofa chair by the lamp, or perhaps the white ottoman that we're standing on?  
561001	  All right, I will add them both to your cart.  
561002	  Sorry, but nothing like that is available.  
561003	  Ok, I'll add those two items to your cart as well.  
561100	  I have the two brown coffee tables by the couches in the center.  
561101	  Alright, I'll add both to your cart.  
561102	  Which brown chair?  
561103	  It is $399 and has a 3.2 rating.  
561200	  There's this blue one and this red one.  
561201	  Okay, I will add that rug to your cart.  
561202	  What do you think of the wooden table?  
561203	  Okay, both items will be added to your cart.  
561300	  I have two coffee tables available in the middle of the room.  
561301	  Of course, they cost $399.  
561302	  What do you think of the white chair in the middle of the room?  
561303	  Of course, I'll add it to your cart.  
561400	  What do you think of this one?  
561401	  Sorry, nothing that matches your search criteria.  
561402	  How about the white one?  
561403	  Ok. I will put that in your cart.  
561500	  There is a grey rug in the back and a white rug in the middle which might suit you.  
561501	  Sure thing.  
561502	  Sorry, I don't have any other blue chairs.  
561503	  Great, I'll add the chaise to your cart.  
561600	  The red rug on the blue rug meets your criteria for a good wool rug.  
561601	  I'm afraid those are the only rugs we have in stock with positive customer reviews.  
561602	  That multicolored rug is what we have matching that description.  
561603	  Which rugs do you mean?  
561700	  Sure! How do you feel about that brown chair to the left in the back or the other brown chair directly in front of that one?  
561701	  Unfortunately, we don't have anything like that. Could I help you find something else?  
561702	  Unfortunately, I have no tables meeting those parameters.  
561703	  Could you tell me what you're referring to?  
561800	  How about the coffee table at the back left?  
561801	  Sorry, those are the only two tables we have.  
561802	  How about the blue rug on the right?  
561803	  Okay, I will add the white area cart.  
561900	  Sure, what do you think of the grey rug to the left?  
561901	  Those are the only ones we have available at the moment.  
561902	  I'm afraid I do not have anything that fits those search parameters. Is there anything else I might be able to help you with?  
561903	  Sure, I'll add that sofa chair and those sofas to your cart.  
562000	  The table in the back to the right would fit what you're looking for.  
562001	  I have two, yes.  Do you like either of the two between the wall?  
562002	  I'll get that in your cart right away.  
562003	  Sorry, I don't have any chair matching that description right now.  
562100	  Do you like this red one?  
562101	  Sure thing! I'll put that rug in your cart for you.  
562102	  Do you like these three?

562203	  Both of those brown ottomans I showed you are all I have to show you.  
562300	  How about the blue and white rug on your left?  
562301	  I found a brown one that's further away.  
562302	  The brown is from Downtown Stylists, and the grey is from Art Den.  
562303	  Okay. I've added those two items to your cart.  
562400	  The brown chair in the far back is a nice option.  
562401	  Those three chairs you saw are all we have.  
562402	  The rug to the right is a natural fiber rug, whereas the rug to the left of the partition is also natural fibers.  
562403	  Both of those are made of natural fibers.  
562500	  How do you like these ones?  
562501	  Both are leather. The white one is $349, and the blue is $399.  
562502	  They're both made of leather, but the long one is $499 and the other $349.  
562503	  Well, I think you might like the gray one in front of the wall and the brown one beside it.  
562600	  I've got this gray sofa right up front on the left.  
562601	  I'm sorry, nothing comes back with the criteria you just asked about.  
562602	  They are made by Home Store.  
562603	  The one in front is from River Chateau and the one in the back is from North Lodge.  
562700	  You might like this white chair by the dining table in the back.  
562701	  Of course, they will be added.  
562702	  Which table are you referring to?  
562703	  That table is made of wood and costs $649.  
562800	  Sorry, but I don't have any affordable coats.  
562801	  I have the brown one in the second cubby from the left, the yellow one in the next cubby over, and the black one hanging in the next cubby over.  
562802	  Yes. I will add them to your cart now.  
562803	  I'm sorry, I don't have anything like that. Can I get you something different?  
562804	  Ok. I will add that now.  
562900	  There are two pairs of grey trousers along the back wall, as well as a pair of blue trousers.  
562901	  Both are available in XS.  
562902	  The grey coat is 109.99 and the other one is 179.99.

563100	  What about these two light grey ones and the grey one?

There's also a black coat on the circular rack directly to the right, and a black coat on the rack closer to the door. All of these black coats are relatively inexpensive.  
620703	  I will add both coats to your cart.  
620704	  Sorry, I'm sorry, which item would you like to know more about?  
620800	  What do you think about the blue jacket in the back right, or maybe the grey jacket on the rack on the right?

620901	  Which one?  
620902	  That jacket is rated 3.4 and costs $174.99.  
620903	  Ok, I will add that now.  
620904	  I don't have anything like that.  
621000	  Do you like the grey ones in the cubbies to the left? They are trousers in size XS with a plain pattern.  
621001	  The blue trousers are size XS and the brown trousers are size L.

621604	  The black hat has a 2.8 rating and the green hat has a 4.0.  
621700	  What about this black jacket on the front right wall and this one on the back of the right wall?  
621701	  That's all for black jackets right now.

691400	  I have two options. There's a black one on the bottom row in the right middle cubby and another black one on the bottom right in the center cubby. Do you like any of those?  
691401	  Sorry, which item would you like the size of?  
691402	  That is a L from North Lodge.  
691403	  Sorry, that's it for the brown hoodie.  
691404	  Ok, great! I'll add that to your cart.  
691500	  How about the wooden one in the middle of the room or the smaller brown table on the striped rug?  
691501	  That table is the only one that fits that description.  
691502	  You might like the grey couches on the blue and brown couches, or the brown ottoman on the red rug.  
691503	  Which table?  
691600	  I've found a grey sofa in the very back right.  
691601	  Sorry, for which item?  
691602	  Thank you! That table is made by Art Den and priced at $399.

691703	  I have two wooden shelves in the back under the grey couch, what do you think?  
691800	  I found three, yes. There's a grey rug to the right of the yellow one and a blue rug in the back to the left.  
691801	  What do you think of the black one next to the white couch chair?  
691802	  Unfortunately, there are no similar rugs.  
691803	  Sure, I am putting them in your cart right now.  
691900	  Sure, I have two red rugs by that brand.  To the left of the partition you can see two white rugs.  
691901	  Sorry, but I can't find anything meeting those requirements.  
691902	  What do you think about this short wooden shelf on the right? It is by Modern Arts.  
691903	  No, that rug has nothing like it.  
692000	  What do you think of the white chair on the left, or the white bench chair directly beside it?  
692001	  Those two items are the only options I have.  
692002	  Okay, adding two black coats now.  
692003	  Okay. I've updated your cart.  
692100	  What do you think of the white rug in front of us or the white rug in the back right?  
692101	  I'm sorry, I didn't get any hits on that search.  
692102	  Sure thing, I will add those to your cart.  
692103	  Okay, I will add that table and the white rug.  
692200	  The grey rug in front of us is an option you may want to consider.  
692201	  Sorry, but no. Would you like to continue shopping?  
692202	  Yes! I am now in your cart.  
692203	  Certainly! That grey sofa will be in your cart in a second.  
692300	  Sure, what do you think of the grey sofa in the back?

692302	  Which one?  
692303	  It's made of leather and from Downtown Stylists.  
692400	  What do you think of the white rug in the back?  
692401	  Can you tell me which one you mean?  
692402	  It's rated 3.1.  
692403	  I'm sorry, that's all I have. Can I get you something different?  
692500	  Of course! Check out the short set of shelves against the wall.  
692501	  I apologize, but I cannot find any wood shelves with a good customer rating.  
692502	  Which rug are you referring to?  
692503	  The one on the right has a more affordable price tag and it costs $499. The one in the back has an even higher price tag, at $499.  
692600	  What do you think of the one at the back on the left?  
692601	  How about the wooden table in the front of the partition?  
692602	  No, I don't see anything else in wood.  
692603	  I'm sorry, there isn't anything else that meets your criteria.  
692700	  What do you think of the white area rug in the back left or the red area rug in the center?  
692701	  Can you clarify what you're referring to?  
692702	  It has a rating of 3.9.  
692703	  No other sofa matching your criteria, sorry.  
692800	  What do you think of the wooden table at the front of the room?  
692801	  Nothing else.  
692802	  It's the only table I found.  
692803	  Okay. It will be added to your cart.  
692900	  How about the grey bookcase in the back?  
692901	  That grey one against the wall to the right is made by the brand you named! What do you think?  
692902	  That's all I have at the moment. Can I get you something else?  
692903	  Adding to your cart.  
693000	  How do you like this white one?  
693001	  Which item are you talking about?  
693002	  It is made out of wool and has a customer rating of 3.8.  
693003	  That one is made out of natural fibers and is made by North Lodge.  
693100	  I've got that light grey option right in the front right of the room, and the red one that's two to the left from it.  
693101	  Those end tables are both from StyleNow Feed and have a score of 4.9 from customers.  
693102	  Certainly! This set of shelves will appear in your cart momentarily.  
693103	  Okay. I'll add those now.  
693200	  How about the one against the wall?  
693201	  That black chair is the only one that fits your search.  
693202	  Here's a wooden shelf on the right.  
693203	  Sorry, which one are you referring to?  
693300	  Sure, what do you think of the tall wooden shelves against the wall on the right?  
693301	  Sure! What do you think of the wooden table next to the partition?  
693302	  Which table are you referring to?  
693303	  It is made of wood and has a 3.2 rating.  
693400	  You may be interested in that long wooden shelf straight ahead, as well as the shorter shelves by the far wall on the left.  
693401	  Both are made out of natural fibers and have a natural-wood finish.  
693402	  Which one?  
693403	  Oh, I'm sorry, that one costs $449.  
693500	  The bottom shelf next to the wall has a good customer rating.  
693501	  Sure! The one further in the middle is a white area rug, while the one further in the back is a red area rug.  
693502	  Sure! I will put those in your cart right away.  
693503	  Sure, I will add that to your cart.  
693600	  Do you like the one in the back or the one in the front?  
693601	  Of course! I'll add that end table and that end table to your cart now.  
693602	  Unfortunately, we don't have any other tables that fit your criteria. Is there something else I can help you find?  
693603	  Which one?  
693700	  I found a grey rug.  
693701	  Sorry, I can't find anything else like that.  
693702	  The gray one on the left, or the one in front of it in the back are similar.  
693703	  I don't have anything like that. Can I help with something else?  
693800	  I have the white chair next to the lamp on the rug in the center of the room.  
693801	  I sure can.  
693802	  What do you think about the brown chair on the left?  
693803	  Adding the wooden table and the end table to your cart.  
693900	  How about that one in the back or the one to the right of it?  
693901	  I don't happen to have any wooden tables in the current price range.  
693902	  You might enjoy the long white striped rug in the middle of the room, as well as the small blue rugs further away on the right.  
693903	  Both tables are made of wood.

694003	  Sure, what do you think of the tall bookcase against the wall?

694101	  Here is a brown one.  
694102	  Which one?  
694103	  This couch chair is $599.  
694200	  Sure, check out the red rug over there.

694202	  Which item are you referring to?  
694203	  Both rugs are from Uptown Studio and have a customer rating of 4.5.  
694300	  How about this wooden table on the other side of the wall?  
694301	  That table is the only one I have right now.  
694302	  Sure, I have two grey rugs in the front right set, what do you think of those?  
694303	  I'm sorry, which rug did you mean?  
694400	  What do you think of the white one to the left of the first rug?  
694401	  Unfortunately, none of those have anything in a white, at least not right now. Can I help you look for anything else?  
694402	  Well aside from that white one, the black and white one on the right above it, and the brown one on the back right are similar to that black and white one.  
694403	  Okay, I'll add both chairs to your cart.  
694500	  Here is a grey one in the middle of the room.  
694501	  Sorry, which items are you talking about?  
694502	  Thank you! Both are made by Uptown Studio.  
694503	  Of course! The wooden one is from StyleNow Feed, and the white one is from Modern Arts.  
694600	  I have a white rug in the back, and another one in the front.  
694601	  They are both made of natural fibers.  
694602	  No problem. I'll add that to your cart for you.  
694603	  Ok, I'll add one of those now.  
694700	  No problem, what do you think of that grey one in the back to the left?  
694701	  That rug from Modern Arts has a high 3.8 customer rating, and the rug I showed you earlier is also made from wool.  
694702	  Which one do you mean?  
694703	  That chair is made by Downtown Stylists.  
694800	  What do you think of the brown chair by the blue rug?  
694801	  I do! Do you like the wooden shelf in the back?

694803	  Great! I'll put both of those in your cart.  
694900	  Here's a white one.  
694901	  I'm sorry, that's all I have like that.  
694902	  How about this red sofa in the front here?  
694903	  I'm sorry, we don't have anything by Modern Arts that's well rated.  
695000	  What do you think of the brown table behind the blue sofa?  
695001	  Which one?  
695002	  It's rated 3.2 and is made of metal.  
695003	  That lamp is the only one we have.  
695100	  There are a couple of wooden shelves you might like. What do you think?  
695101	  How about the wooden shelves against the wall?  
695102	  The one on the right is rated 3.9, while the one on the left has a 4.2.  
695103	  Both rugs have a 3.6 rating.

695201	  Sorry I don't have anything like that.  
695202	  Sure thing.  
695203	  What do you think of the grey shelves to the left? They are made by Modern Arts and cost $399.  
695300	  How about the black ones in the back, the red ones in the middle, or maybe the brown ones in front?  
695301	  What do you think of that set to the left of the dining table?  
695302	  I think you might be fine with the grey rug under the sofas!  
695303	  They both have a wood color and come from North Lodge. The rug in the back by the shop is a large. The rug in the front by the shop is also made of wood.  
695400	  Sure, there's a white table at the back on the left.  
695401	  Great, I'll add it to your cart for you.  
695402	  Sorry, but we don't have any other wooden tables in stock.  
695403	  Sorry, which one?  
695500	  What do you think of this grey one?  
695501	  Which sofa are you talking about?  
695502	  Thank you! That sofa is made out of leather and costs $599.  
695503	  What about the brown one next to that brown chair?  
695600	  We have a couple of grey ones that might interest you.  
695601	  I'm sorry, but I don't have anything that fits those preferences. Can I get you something different?  
695602	  I'm sorry, this is the only one I can find in that style.  
695603	  Ok, I will add the white rug and the chair to your cart.  
695700	  How about the one on the right?  
695701	  Both of these tables have a 3.9 rating.  
695702	  The wooden one has a 2.9, and the white one has a 3.2.  
695703	  I think the white chair on the left would be the closest option.  
695800	  Take a look at the wooden shelves just to the left of the partition wall in front of us.  
695801	  I have these two grey sofas in the back in the center of the room.  
695802	  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be anything in stock that fits those criteria.  
695803	  Great, I'll add it to your cart.  
695900	  Sure, there's a wooden one just past the brown chair that you can see on the left.  
695901	  Sorry, which table are you interested in?  
695902	  Sure, for $399 it's from StyleNow Feed, while the one you're looking at is from 212 Local, and it's also made of wood.  
695903	  That rug, as well as a white rug on the right also fit your search.  
696000	  How about these two in the far back right?  
696001	  The only black option I have is the one behind the two rugs you just saw.  
696002	  Great. I'll add that to your cart.  
696003	  Sorry, which one?  
696100	  What do you think about the blue one in front?  
696101	  Sorry, we don't have anything like that.  
696102	  Sure thing.  
696103	  Sorry, which one?  
696200	  That wooden shelf in the back left set might be of interest.  
696201	  Sure thing.  
696202	  Sorry, but I don't have any wooden shelves made from natural fibers from Modern Arts.  
696203	  That black chair is from 212 Local.  
696300	  What do you think about this brown sofa in the back?  
696301	  That gray one fits what you are looking for.  
696302	  How about these? There's these two brown ones, and this white one?  
696303	  Which ones are you talking about?  
696400	  Here's one.

696402	  Which one?  
696403	  It has a 3.9 rating and costs $399.

696502	  Which one?  
696503	  Yes, that rug has a rating of 3.4.  
696600	  What do you think of the white one on the right or the other white one on the left? They're both leather.  
696601	  That chair is now in your cart.  
696602	  Which rugs do you mean?  
696603	  Those are made by Home Store and are made of wool.  
696700	  Of course! How about this wooden shelf in the center of the room?  
696701	  Sure, if you look at the back left you can see a tall set of shelves on the white rug.  
696702	  These two white shelves are the only ones I have.  
696703	  Great. I will add them to your cart right away!  
696800	  I can recommend the two blue and white shirts and the brown shirt.

696900	  In the right closet, I have the dark blue trousers in the second closest cabinet, and the brown ones in the third cabinet.  
696901	  I am sorry, I donâ€™t have any other highly rated trousers.  
696902	  I'm sorry, which ones?  
696903	  Which pants are you referring to?  
696904	  They cost 239.99.

697002	  The one in the back is a M and the other is a L.  
697003	  Sorry, I don't have anything like that.

712401	  We only have that one rug.  
712402	  Sorry, I don't have any other rugs with a good rating.  
712403	  Sorry, but I couldn't find any wool rugs with a low price tag.  
712500	  Do you like the one in the back right?  
712501	  No, sorry.

713402	  No problem, both have been added to your cart.  
713403	  Sure, I'll add two of those coffee tables to your cart.

714001	  Unfortunately, we don't have any affordable area rugs right now.  
714002	  There are several white sofa chairs along the wall, one is a grey sofa chair. What do you think?

715301	  We have another white option, to the right of that grey one.

716502	  Which ones do you mean?  
716503	  The one in front is made of wood and the other one is made of wood.  
716600	  Take a look at the white rug in the middle of the room, as well as the black and white striped rug on the right.  
716601	  How about the white sofa in the back?  
716602	  Not that I could find.  
716603	  Sorry, no matches could be found.  
716700	  You may like the grey one in the center of the room or the grey one to its left.  
716701	  I'll add both to your cart.  
716702	  Both of those couches are the best matches for your needs.  
716703	  Great. I'll add those two items to your cart now.  
716800	  How about the grey one in the back right, or maybe the white one in the front center?  
716801	  Sorry, which one?  
716802	  This couch is rated 3.3 and by Modern Arts.  
716803	  Sorry, I don't have anything like that.  
716900	  How about these two brown ones in front of the partition?  
716901	  What do you think of the one on the right?  
716902	  The one on the right is made of wool and the other one is also wool.  
716903	  Both are made of wool. The grey rug has a natural fibers brand. The other rug is also wool and retails for $199.  
717000	  Take a look at this white sofa and that grey one.  
717001	  The white one is by StyleNow Feed, has a 2.9 rating, and is priced at $399. It is made of wood, has a wood finish, and is the only one that fits your criteria. The other one is from StyleNow Feed, is more expensive at $399, and is made of wood, with a wood finish.  
717002	  Which two items do you mean?  
717003	  Both are rated at 3.1 and by 212 Local.  
717100	  Sure, the two grey coffee tables along the left edge of the grey rug would make a great pick.  
717101	  Sorry, I'm sorry. Could you help me find something else?  
717102	  I'll take care of that for you.  
717103	  Those aren't exactly what I'm interested in.  
717200	  Sure, over on the right side I have the blue rug, and in the middle right corner is a brown rug.  
717201	  Which one are you referring to?  
717202	  That rug is $499 and made of natural fibers.  
717203	  Unfortunately, that rug is the only one that meets your search requirements.  
717300	  What do you think of that white rug behind the blue sofa, or maybe the one just beyond that?  
717301	  Certainly, brown ones are on the way.  
717302	  Both coffee tables are made by Art Den and are both made of metal.  
717303	  I have a brown sofa way at the back that's up close and personal with the white couch in the middle of the room.  
717400	  In the back, I have the gray coffee table at the far end of the grey rug, and the other gray coffee table closer to the rug.  
717401	  Okay, I will add it to your cart.  
717402	  Great! There's a blue area rug at the back right of the room, or a white rug with a similar color scheme. What do you think?  
717403	  Got it! You will see them in your cart in just a sec.  
717500	  What do you think about that wooden table on the right?  
717501	  No, I don't have anything matching that description.  
717502	  Which tables?  
717503	  They're both wood tables.  
717600	  How about the two brown ones in back?  
717601	  Both of these end tables are made of wood.  
717602	  That table is metal, and has a 3.5 rating.  
717603	  Sorry, I don't see any coffee tables that are similar in terms of brand.  
717700	  What do you think about the brown table or the grey one?  
717701	  Those two are the only tables like that at the moment.  
717702	  I don't happen to have any tables that fit that description.  
717703	  Which ones are you referring to?  
717800	  Of course, what do you think of the one against the wall?  
717801	  That is the only one in that color.  
717802	  Nothing I have matches that criteria. Can I help you find anything else?  
717803	  You got it. I'll add that to your cart.  
717900	  How do you like these options?  
717901	  These are both wool rugs.  
717902	  Ok, I will add both of these items to your cart.

718000	  I have one right next to the wall. What do you think?  
718001	  Sorry, that's the only option available.  
718002	  The one in the front is $599 and the one to the left is $599.  
718003	  Both rugs are made by Uptown Studio and are made of wool.  
718100	  The grey sofa we have is highly rated. Is it the one you're looking for?  
718101	  Oh no, I'm afraid I cannot find any sofas fitting your description.  
718102	  I couldn't find anything else, sorry.  
718103	  Of course, I've added them to your cart.  
718200	  What about the grey one on the right?  
718201	  Sorry, I don't see anything with those criteria.  
718202	  No, I'm sorry. Nothing else can be found for you. Is there anything else I could assist you with?

718300	  Got it! Tell me what you think of that grey sofa on the red rug next to the red sofa and the wooden end table on the other red rug, as well as the other white one beside it.

718302	  No, nothing in this selection fits that description.  
718303	  Okay, I'll add the sofa and end table to your cart.

718500	  Take a look at this grey sofa in the back?  
718501	  Which item would you like to know about?  
718502	  That sofa is made out of leather.  
718503	  For which item?  
718600	  How about the grey sofa in the back?

718901	  I don't have any sofas at the moment.  
718902	  No problem, I've added that to your cart.

719001	  Great! I'll add that jacket now.  
719002	  I don't have any green and white jackets in colors like that.  
719003	  Do you like the black coat on the back right rack or the brown one on the left side?  
719004	  Of course, I've updated your cart to include both coats.  
719100	  Take a look at this black coat on the front left rack, this light grey coat on the left rack, and this black coat on the right rack? They match your criteria.

719102	  Sorry, those are the only ones available.  
719103	  Which one are you talking about?  
719104	  That is a size XXL.  
719200	  Perhaps you'd like that blue one on the rack?  
719201	  That red and white one and that black sweater that we were seeing earlier have long sleeves.  
719202	  Which dress do you mean?  
719203	  Of course, I'll update your cart with those!  
719204	  Absolutely! I will add those to your cart.  
719300	  What about this pink and white shirt?  
719301	  They are both jackets.

720203	  I apologize, but there are no affordable area rugs at this time. Is there something else I can help you with?  
720300	  What do you think of this white one?  
720301	  Which rugs do you mean?  
720302	  The white is made from natural fibers, and the other is wool.

725101	  Sure, take a look at the white rug at the back right.  
725102	  Absolutely. I've added it to your cart.  
725103	  Unfortunately, that brown one at the back is that price range.  
725200	  I can suggest the white ottoman on our immediate right and the red ottoman on our immediate left. Do you like either of them?

726103	  Certainly, I'll add that to your cart now!

726201	  Which one are you referring to?  
726202	  That chair is made of leather and from Downtown Stylists.  
726203	  No, I don't have anything like that.  Is there something else I can show you?  
726300	  I have this white rug in the front.  
726301	  Sorry, I can't find anything that matches your search.  
726302	  Which two are you referring to?  
726303	  The one in front is made by North Lodge, and the one in back is made by River Chateau.

726401	  I have that one in the back of the room, as well as the brown one behind it.  
726402	  I'm adding that to your cart right now.  
726403	  You've got it.  
726500	  Sorry, that is the only priced area rug currently in stock.  
726501	  How about the one in the back?  
726502	  Both are memory foam beds.  
726503	  I only have the ones available right now.  
726600	  I found this white chair.  
726601	  Take a look at the bed on the right, in the top middle.

726803	  That bed is made of memory foam.  
726900	  In that case, I have the two wood tables in the back against the wall.  
726901	  I think you might be interested in that black one on the other side of that rug, or maybe the other black chair on the opposite side of the red rug.  
726902	  This chair, along with the other white chair you looked at previously would be perfect for your needs.

727203	  Great! I'll add it to your cart.  
727300	  Sorry, I don't.  
727301	  I'm afraid I don't.  Could I help you find something else?  
727302	  How about this table on the right?  
727303	  Of course, I'll update your cart accordingly.  
727400	  We have this blue rug in the middle.  
727401	  Sure, they're both made of wool.  
727402	  How about the brown one next to the gray sofa or the one in front of the red couch?  
727403	  I will add that to your cart.  
727500	  How about the bed against the back wall?  
727501	  Unfortunately, I do not see any highly-rated beds by StyleNow Feed.  
727502	  Unfortunately, I cannot find anything similar. Is there something else you need?  
727503	  Excellent choice. I will add those items to your cart now.  
727600	  I have three you might like, a brown and a white.  
727601	  These two are the only similar beds I have.

727801	  For which item?  
727802	  It is made by Downtown Stylists and has a customer rating of 3.1.  
727803	  This chair is a brown leather chair.  
727900	  Sure, what do you think of the one in the far back?  If you're looking for something more extravagant, the taller table beside the wall could also be of interest.

730601	  I have the dark blue ones in the bottom left cubby on the right, the blue jeans next to them, and the light blue ones at the far end of the right cubby.  
730602	  The black one is in XL and the light grey one is in size S.  
730603	  No, there isn't anything like that currently in stock.  
730604	  Yes, take a look at the grey jacket to the right and this black jacket to the left, the other black one to the right of them, and the blue jacket hanging next to the grey coat.
